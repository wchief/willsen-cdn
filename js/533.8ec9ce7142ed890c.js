I was just jumping down, something we kids did all the time on the glacier. But this time, I was wrong. Beneath the deceptive white was hard, slippery ice. I lost my footing and fell - fifteen feet down - slamming onto my back and head. I was knocked out cold.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Grey Days and a Silent Brain</h2>\\n<p>\\nFor an entire week, I was blind. Everything I saw was just grey. The doctors told us it was a severe concussion. Nobody knew what had really happened - not even me. A friend helped me get up and somehow brought me home. My dad took me to the hospital for an examination, but I don’t remember any of it. In fact, the next few years are mostly a blank.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Hidden Damage Revealed Years Later</h2>\\n<p>\\nIt wasn’t until I was in my 30s, during a CT scan, that a doctor casually mentioned I had once cracked my skull. Suddenly everything made sense. I’d always wondered why heading a football would make me dizzy when all the other boys could do it without a problem. I used to speculate about it, but instead of dwelling, I found new passions.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>From Blank Space to Arctic Creativity</h2>\\n<p>\\nThe long and dark Arctic winters offered their own kind of therapy. I dove into music with my friends, letting rhythms and melodies fill the empty spaces in my memory. I also picked up a strange new habit: making statistics of everything around me. It became an obsession of sorts. Then I discovered coding - starting with assembler. That saved me. It gave structure to a mind that had been shaken loose.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Mind That Changed</h2>\\n<p>\\nEven though nobody really talked about it, I knew something had changed in me after the fall. But it wasn’t until much later that I truly realized I was not like everyone else. I couldn’t explain it, and I still can’t fully. But I started having visions - moments where I could predict events before they happened. \\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>When the Future Became Familiar</h2>\\n<p>\\nAt first, I thought it was coincidence. But the more it happened, the harder it was to deny. I began telling friends about small things I felt would happen in a week or two. Some came true - too many, in fact. It started to scare them. Eventually, I stopped talking about it. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe last time I ever mentioned a prediction was when I told my siblings, two weeks ahead, that George Michael would die. And then it happened. We all kept an eye on the news after that moment. It was real, and it was terrifying.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Stroke That Took Me Deeper</h2>\\n<p>\\nThen came the massive stroke - a new turning point. Whatever door the glacier fall had opened in my mind, the stroke kicked it wide open. Things started happening on a whole new level. I can\'t describe most of it, and I’ve long stopped trying to explain. Some people might think I’m crazy - maybe I am. But I know what I’ve felt, seen, and lived through.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Life Forever Tilted</h2>\\n<p>\\nThat fall, those fifteen feet, changed everything. It stole parts of me, but gave me other strange, indescribable gifts in return. I’ll never know what exactly happened in those moments I was unconscious, or what rewired in my brain. But one thing is certain: I’ve never been the same.\\n</p>\\n","date":"2025-04-02","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/lars-willsen-glacier-fall.png","imageAlt":"The Glacier Fall That Changed Everything - Lars Willsen","socialImage":null},{"id":"7d27a70e-63cf-4d15-88d6-6785924f5c85","title":"Too Much Love: A Soundtrack for the Next American Psycho X","slug":"too-much-love-a-soundtrack-for-the-next-american-psycho-x","content":"<p>\\"Too Much Love\\" wasn’t written for a film. But it feels like it was made for one. Specifically, a sequel that doesn\'t exist - yet. Think <strong>American Psycho X</strong>. This time, with a woman at the center of it all. Cold. Controlled. Unapologetic.</p>\\n\\n<p>The track opens soft. \\"<em>Fly with me / Shine with me</em>\\"  -  an invitation, but it’s not clear where we’re going. The tone is seductive, detached. A luxury high-rise in Manhattan. Marble floors. The hum of a vintage stereo system. Think Phil Collins, but updated: sleeker, colder.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Luxury and Madness</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the universe of American Psycho, beauty hides blood. \\"Too Much Love\\" taps into that same paradox. The song drifts. Then flickers. It never settles. Each verse is like a different room in a pristine penthouse - minimal, spotless, hiding something beneath the surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>Verse one: \\"<em>Drifting slow / Fading / Waking</em>\\" - the slow unraveling. Verse two: \\"<em>Touch and go / Flicker / Whisper</em>\\" - moments of intimacy that never fully connect. By verse three, \\"<em>Close my eyes / Echo / Halo</em>\\"  -  we’re almost out of body. Floating above the violence we refuse to name.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Her World</h2>\\n\\n<p>Imagine the protagonist: a woman in her thirties. Polished. Powerful. She moves through the city like she owns it - because she kind of does. The track mirrors her perfectly. Not in a rush. Not showing emotion. Every sound is calculated. Stylish, but unsettling.</p>\\n\\n<p>The chorus - \\"<em>Wonders, for you / Too much, love</em>\\" - could be read as devotion. Or obsession. Or a threat. That’s the trick. It means all of them at once. That ambiguity is the core of both the film and the music.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Fade Out</h2>\\n\\n<p>The outro returns to where it began. \\"<em>Fly with me / Shine with me</em>\\"  -  but now it’s slower, fading out like the lights in a penthouse after something terrible just happened. It’s not over. But the night is.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"Too Much Love\\" doesn’t scream. It whispers. And in a world of curated chaos, that’s what makes it terrifying. It belongs in <em>American Psycho X</em> - not as a soundtrack filler, but as the mood-setter. The warning sign. The siren song playing as she walks away.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter Two: Show Me That You Love Me</h2>\\n\\n<p>The story continues with the second single, <strong>\\"Show Me That You Love Me\\"</strong>  -  a follow-up that digs deeper into the mind of our icy lead. Where the first track hinted, this one pushes. It\'s not about mystery anymore - it\'s about control.</p>\\n\\n<p>Set in the same lavish, sterile world of wealth and power, this track carries a sharper edge. The title isn’t a plea. It’s a test. A mirror held up to the listener. How far would you go to be seen, to be wanted - to be loved?</p>\\n\\n<p>Stylistically, the sound is even more stripped down. Cold synths. Deliberate pacing. Her voice - calm, but loaded. The tension is thick. Every beat calculated. You feel like you\'re watching something private that you shouldn’t be seeing.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"Show Me That You Love Me\\" is the moment the audience realizes: she was never looking for love. She was looking for control. And now, she\'s got it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Together, the two singles form the core of <em>Salty White Substance</em> - a minimalist, psychological descent wrapped in polish and perfection. This is more than music. It\'s mood. It\'s menace. And it\'s just the beginning.</p>\\n\\n<p><div style=\\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ceuuDENgLxw?si=pJCmBIsf3jSQFgN5\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" \\n    referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" \\n    allowfullscreen \\n    style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\">\\n  </iframe>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<p><div style=\\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gmO3bjQwJ6k?si=hpSI4ECAQdbUq1UR\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" \\n    referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" \\n    allowfullscreen \\n    style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\">\\n  </iframe>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<p>There will be those that can’t see the humorous aspect ..

These compositions, largely unheard before their release, are part of my ongoing \\"demo tapes” project - an effort to share decades of private music, written in solitude and silence, with the world.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Long Time Ago in the Future</h2>\\n<p>\\n  Several of the tracks on this album were born during train rides between Nyborg and Horsens, back when I was commuting during rehearsal periods. The rhythm of the train and the blurred Danish landscape provided the perfect atmosphere to capture the feeling of distant futures rooted in old memories. This track is dedicated to Ken Hammer from Pretty Maids.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>CPH Gate 58, Copenhagen Airport</h2>\\n<p>\\n  This track comes from a vision I had long before my daughter was born - a vision of her leaving early in life, just like I did. Years later, that vision became real when she courageously traveled to South Korea all on her own. The piece is filled with emotion, longing, pride, and the cyclical nature of life.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>I\'ll Be Your Angel</h2>\\n<p>\\n  This one is hauntingly prophetic. I saw the shadow of my massive stroke a year before it happened. Driven by that vision, I felt a deep urgency to record my youth in music - to capture the essence of who I was before my body betrayed me. This track is a dedication to the guardian angel I needed and perhaps became through my music.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Morud</h2>\\n<p>\\n  A gentle, easy listening piece dedicated to the peaceful village of Morud - where my wife grew up and where we now live. It\'s surrounded by forests and quietude, and this track reflects the serenity and stability I’ve found here after years of personal turbulence.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>El Capitan</h2>\\n<p>\\n  I’ve always been fascinated by mountains. Having climbed Mont Blanc and local giants like the mountain of Uummannaq and Qilertinnguit in Greenland, I’ve developed a spiritual connection with high places. \\"El Capitan\\" is a tribute to those towering symbols of strength and perseverance.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Demo Tapes Project</h2>\\n<p>\\n  All my releases - including \\"Serotonin Bloom\\" - should be seen as part of my demo tapes project. After writing over 800 songs and re-recording more than 200 before my stroke, I’ve been able to release them with just a slight polish. These are not just tracks - they\'re memories, warnings, hopes, and thanks.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Gift to Humanity</h2>\\n<p>\\n  This album is my way of giving back to the human race. I\'ve spent a life navigating hardship, often alone, and music has always been my way of processing those emotions. Through these instrumental synth pieces, I invite listeners to feel the world as I did - to walk through my visions, memories, and truths.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><div style=\\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRmTm2lWqJU?si=j47uePz4A7MDTaRE\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" \\n    referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" \\n    allowfullscreen \\n    style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\">\\n  </iframe>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<h2>Listen and Reflect</h2>\\n<p>\\n  Take a moment to sit with this album.

I\'m old, I\'ll just sit around and wait to die.\\" But then I stopped myself. \\"Wait a minute, that\'s not me.\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I\'ve been through it all - drugs, danger, and the kind of insane shit that most people wouldn\'t even attempt. I climbed Mont Blanc, climbed my local mountain from the north side with nothing but water, two Yankie bars, and a torch lamp. In case I needed to signal anyone… not that I had a chance in hell of getting anyone\'s attention from up there.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then there were the 30+ years where I never played a single note. I tell myself, well… at least I didn\'t have to deal with more primadonnas and fake people.

But hey, I accepted my fate.</p>\\n\\n<p>I had a vision, and I knew a stroke was coming. That\'s why I started re-recording all my old shit - to document <strong>me</strong>, the real me, and no one else. Everything you hear on streaming services? I kept it a secret. They were side-projects. Lucky for me, MIDI existed back then, so I saved my music onto floppy disks - some with lyrics, others with bits of sound. No regrets.</p>\\n\\n<p>I spent time in mental hospitals a few times. They locked the doors, had guards watching my every move. I even tried electrocuting myself using the lamp cables while holding the tap. But it\'s Denmark… you can\'t electrocute yourself. They\'ve got fuses and safety systems in place to make sure no one checks out that way.</p>\\n\\n<p>The parties were insane. When I was coding, I made between 60-100K a month.

Unlike the stereotypical ambient tracks commonly heard on streaming platforms, his compositions weave deep narratives, emotional depth, and cinematic textures into extended soundscapes. His works span relaxation, meditation, and immersive storytelling, with tracks lasting from 15 minutes up to an hour.</p>\\n\\n<p>A prime example of this is his 6 - hour - long album, <i>Nexos (Selected Ambient Tracks Volume I)</i>, available on <a href=\\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2b7vxx4V57mLqR7tPlMkbV?si=ESwv8Ic7RGCg-2SNiWn0Yg\\">Spotify</a>, Apple Music, Amazon, and all major streaming platforms. This 15 - track collection showcases Willsen\'s ability to create long - form ambient experiences that are unlike anything else in the genre.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Nexos (Selected Ambient Tracks Volume I) - An Expansive Sonic Journey</h2>\\n\\n<p>Each track on <i>Nexos</i> tells a story, whether it\'s a reflection on personal experiences, a sonic exploration of the unknown, or a deep dive into meditative states. Some of the most notable tracks include:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><b>\\"Void\\"</b> - A piece that has gained notable popularity, likely because it resonates deeply with those who discover it. A drifting, weightless journey into the vastness of nothingness.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"B - 2 Detector\\"</b> - A sonic representation of flight, inspired by the experience of moving through the air and the stealth and mystery of the legendary aircraft.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"Stroke\\"</b> and <b>\\"Coma\\"</b> - Deeply personal compositions reflecting Willsen\'s own experiences with a stroke and the altered states of consciousness that followed.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"Unknown Species\\"</b> - A 33 - minute odyssey into the unknown, a journey beyond human understanding into new sonic territories.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"I Am DB Cooper\\"</b> - A cryptic and mysterious track inspired by one of history\'s greatest aviation mysteries.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Each composition is crafted to be more than just background noise - it is an evolving, dynamic piece of art meant to be experienced in full.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Sound Beyond the Stereotypical Ambient Genre</h2>\\n\\n<p>Many ambient artists follow predictable patterns, but Willsen\'s music defies convention. His ambient tracks incorporate cinematic structures, unique tonal shifts, and an emotional depth that stands apart from the generic loops and drones that dominate the genre. His work does not conform to the commercial expectations of relaxation music - it is immersive, thought - provoking, and deeply atmospheric.</p>\\n\\n<p>For those seeking ambient music with substance, emotion, and storytelling, Lars Willsen\'s long - form ambient tracks are a must - listen.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Listen to Lars Willsen\'s Ambient Works</h2>\\n\\n<p>Many of these tracks can also be found on Lars Willsen\'s official YouTube channel: <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/@larswillsen/videos\\">Lars Willsen YouTube</a>.

One such moment for me took place in the mid-70s, aboard a Sikorsky S-61 helicopter flying over the remote wilderness of Greenland.</p>\\n\\n<p>We were returning home after spending a long summer in Denmark. My mother and two siblings had stayed behind and would follow later. Back then, travel between Greenlandic cities was often by helicopter, and this flight was no different. Departing from Kangerlussuaq (S\xf8ndre Str\xf8m), we were set to land in several towns along the way to drop off passengers and refuel. The helicopter was packed - fifteen passengers, plus two pilots and a mechanic. The front right seats had been removed to accommodate a large amount of mail. Among the passengers was my father’s cousin.</p>\\n\\n<p>Flying in Greenland is always unpredictable, but nothing could have prepared us for the storm we encountered that day. It struck without warning as we reached the Nuussuaq Peninsula, north of Disko Island. The Swedish pilots were known to be some of the best - hardcore professionals who had faced all manner of challenges. But even they struggled against the extreme winds. The helicopter was tossed around like a toy, fighting to maintain control. I wasn’t scared, not yet - my father sat beside me, looking completely calm despite the chaos unfolding around us. That calmness reassured me, even as we were slammed against our seatbelts.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then came the sounds - loud bangs like metal breaking apart, followed by an eerie screaming noise, as if something was being torn open. I turned to my father, searching his face for any sign of concern. He remained composed, but around us, passengers were beginning to panic. The pilots were locked in a desperate struggle against the storm, doing everything they could to regain stability.</p>\\n\\n<p>Suddenly, the helicopter began an unnatural slow spin. Something was terribly wrong. We descended rapidly, plummeting toward the landscape below. Then, with a bone-jarring impact, we crashed onto a sand basin nestled between towering mountains. The pilots wasted no time - engines were shut off immediately. The mechanic threw open the door and leapt out, followed by the rest of us, stumbling onto the cold, barren ground.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was my father’s cousin who first spotted it - the reason we were still alive. He pointed to the tail rudder shaft. The metal casing had been ripped wide open. The tail rotor - critical for stability - had nearly been sheared off. Just a few more inches, and we would have been sent into an uncontrollable spin, plummeting to certain death. The realization hit everyone at once. We had come within moments of disaster.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Strangers in the Storm</h2>\\n\\n<p>But then, something even stranger happened.</p>\\n\\n<p>We were stranded in the middle of nowhere, deep in an uninhabited stretch of Greenland. No settlements, no people - only mountains and the howling storm. And yet, someone was watching us.</p>\\n\\n<p><div style=\\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FTOxmzAp3s?si=tHHuphgxIkCGwGrR\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" \\n    referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" \\n    allowfullscreen \\n    style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\">\\n  </iframe>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<h2>Aftermath</h2>\\n\\n<p>The storm raged on. The pilots finally established radio contact, and hours later, another helicopter arrived to rescue us. We were flown to safety, but the encounter was never truly explained. Over the years, it was rarely spoken of - only mentioned in hushed conversations, with theories ranging from divine intervention to spirits of the land watching over us.</p>\\n\\n<p>To this day, I don’t know what I saw. But I know what I experienced. And that experience shaped me - after that day, there was little left in the world that could truly scare me.</p>\\n\\n<p>My song <em>Crash</em> is an instrumental piece inspired by that event. A memory of a near-fatal descent and the presence of something beyond explanation, standing in the storm, watching us from the shadows.</p>","date":"2025-03-11","excerpt":"","category":"Personal","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/chopper.png","imageAlt":"","socialImage":null},{"id":"957e9167-eb5c-4adc-ac3d-314441b22713","title":"Rootless: A Lost Album Reclaimed","slug":"rootless-a-lost-album-reclaimed","content":"<h2>The Long Road to Release</h2>\\n\\n<p>Some albums take years to make, others take decades to see the light of day. <em>Rootless</em> is one of those records that fell into the void of \'what could have been\' - until now.

Re-recorded, remastered, and alive once more, this 8-track mini album now stands as a testament to persistence, artistic integrity, and the sheer refusal to let history erase what was meant to be heard.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Tracks</h2>\\n\\n<p>The album features a mix of synth-driven rock, dark atmospheres, and melodic storytelling:</p>\\n\\n<p><div style=\\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qbBrTxFnMRQ?si=KdZAnPeAAq-aGXfW\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" \\n    referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" \\n    allowfullscreen \\n    style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\">\\n  </iframe>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li>You\'re So Hot</li>\\n<li>The Black Angel</li>\\n<li>Springtime in Osaka</li>\\n<li>Do You Do I (Radio Edit)</li>\\n<li>Blood Path</li>\\n<li>Kaylah</li>\\n<li>GOH Gate 3</li>\\n<li>No More Pain (Short Version)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>A Dedication to Those Who Still Believe</h2>\\n\\n<p>This release isn’t just about reclaiming an album - it’s a shout-out to all my friends and supporters.

But that’s the beauty of rediscovery. <em>Rootless</em> is not just an album from the past; it’s a statement for the present.</p>\\n\\n<p>Some things take courage to bring back to life. This is one of them. And here we are. Finally.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, turn it up and let’s do just that. :-)</p>","date":"2025-03-08","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/rootless-fullalbum1920x1080.png","imageAlt":"","socialImage":null},{"id":"05b1f985-3944-4eff-b29e-c44b0ef95d50","title":"The Day I Chose Music Over Graduation","slug":"the-day-i-chose-music-over-graduation","content":"<p>Music has always been my lifeline, my escape, my truth.</p>\\n\\n<p>It meant so much to me back when I graduated high school - or rather, when I was supposed to. The truth is, I never showed up. I never collected the diploma, never stood in line with my classmates to mark the end of that chapter. While they celebrated, I was in a basement rehearsal room, writing a song called <em>Strong</em> - a song that I will finally release soon. When you hear it, you\'ll know exactly what was going through my mind that day.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Different Path</h2>\\n\\n<p>Most students went home that day, some traveling far away to their families. But somehow, I didn’t feel like I belonged there. It’s incredible to think about now, looking back more than 40 years later. Still, I did great afterward in a different way - through coding. I was lucky that I learned to program in assembly as a kid, and I can confidently say that skill alone shaped a huge part of my life. Later, I earned certifications from Stockholm University in computer science, mastering math-crunching like it was second nature. That was one of the reasons why the Swedish military took an interest in me.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Success and Excess</h2>\\n\\n<p>I lived most of my life alone. I wrote a million songs. Life was never easy for me. I was sent more than 3,000 miles away from home to attend school in Europe when I was very young. I was ripped away from my friends, from my roots. Looking back, sometimes I wish I had just stayed and lived a simple life. But fate had different plans.</p>\\n\\n<p>By the 90s, I was earning more than many top CEOs. And I partied just as hard. Sometimes I woke up in mental hospitals - not because I was mentally ill, but because of the extreme consequences of substance abuse. I saw it all, lived it all, and in the end, I found my wife. Since then, I have never partied like that again.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\\n\\n<p>Do I have regrets? No. But I did learn one thing: never give a second chance to those who did you wrong. I learned that early on, and it kept me on a path where nobody could touch me. Nobody can truly say they know me. Maybe one or two people have an idea, but the rest? They have no clue.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Life on the Move</h2>\\n\\n<p>As I mentioned, I worked in the Swedish military, and they gave me a cover job at a civilian IT company. That life took me all over - Lule\xe5, Uppsala, Stockholm, Kalmar, Malm\xf6, and places I barely remember. I lived in hotels as if they were home. My expenses were pre-paid, and somehow, I always managed to convince the bartenders to send bottles up to my room to knock me out after long and stressful coding sessions. I was so efficient that they let me do whatever I wanted. I have many stories - things most people will never experience. But I lived them all.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Looking Back</h2>\\n\\n<p>And now, here I am, sitting with a brain damaged from a recent stroke, reflecting on the life I’ve lived. Despite everything, I have a beautiful daughter. In the end, I really can’t ask for more.</p>\\n\\n<p>Greenland had no job opportunities for me - those levels in coding didn’t even exist, and they still don’t, as most IT work is outsourced to Danish companies. All of us who were sent to Denmark were misled by a school system run by Denmark. We were shuffled from school to school without any real purpose other than to graduate, only to end up working as ‘slaves’ for the administration back home. Banks and the government made it nearly impossible to start a business.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, instead, I traveled the world and learned a lot along the way. I have coded across most of Europe and North America and was even hired by major players when the Internet arrived in Denmark - almost two years after Sweden. At the time, there were the usual millionaires scrambling to claim the biggest share, some of them quite famous in Denmark. I won’t mention names, but a few of them still owe me a significant amount of money.</p>","date":"2025-03-08","excerpt":"","category":"Personal Life","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/synthfreak_The_Day_I_Chose_Music_Over_Graduation_a_dark_long__2537e379-5eab-49b8-accf-2dfbad201c82_2-2.png","imageAlt":"","socialImage":null},{"id":"90eeb0d8-5830-4bb0-a4d2-0dcdc1d06a88","title":"Writing Music After a Stroke: My Journey of Rediscovery","slug":"writing-music-after-a-stroke-my-journey-of-rediscovery","content":"<h2>Lost Chords and a New Reality</h2>\\n<p>Imagine listening to a track you once knew inside out, but now, you can’t connect three chords in rapid succession. You “see” the chords somewhere in your mind, but they slip away before you can string them together. That’s been my reality since a blood clot hit the left side of my brain. The doctors couldn’t dissolve it - it was too late. Yet, amidst the challenges, something unexpected happened: my tinnitus disappeared, and for the first time in decades, I could smell food while watching cooking videos.</p>\\n\\n<p>This newfound sensory clarity came with an odd side effect: I began to smell chords and see their colors in real-time. It’s as if my brain is compensating for what was lost, amplifying other senses to make up for the gaps.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Music and a Secret Past</h2>\\n<p>But back to music - my lifeline. In the mid-\'80s, I was a beta tester for Cubase, and I was good at it. Music was my world until an unfortunate event rendered my fingers unable to play keyboards. In response, I buried myself in my other passion: assembly coding. I coded for the Swedish military under a cover job that silenced my story for over 30 years. Not even my closest friends knew the truth. Music disappeared from my life entirely.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Chance Encounter</h2>\\n<p>Fast forward to 2021, when fate nudged me back. A chance encounter with someone who needed help with a music video reignited a dormant spark. I offered to help and ended up adding Hammond B3 organ parts using GarageBand. For the first time in over three decades, I touched a musical instrument. That small act snowballed into something life-changing. My wife and daughter gifted me a home studio for my 60th birthday, and I began re-recording thousands of tracks stored on ancient Atari floppy disks from my Cubase days.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Relearning Everything</h2>\\n<p>I had to relearn everything: how to use a DAW, play an instrument, and navigate the intricacies of modern music production - compression, EQ, effects, and more. By the end of 2022, I was making progress. And then, on December 18th, 2022, a massive stroke hit. Game over.</p>\\n\\n<p>Or so I thought.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Road to Recovery</h2>\\n<p>The recovery was grueling - 15 months of physiotherapy, relearning basic skills, and piecing my life back together with my wife fighting for me every step of the way. By the end of 2024, I found myself slowly building a new reality. Disability pension granted me some security, and though life is slower now, I’ve returned to making music, even releasing several tracks.</p>\\n\\n<p>It’s a lonely road. I’ve disconnected from social media, relying solely on YouTube to share my work. I haven’t seen or spoken to friends since the stroke, and my brain damage requires 10–12 hours of sleep nightly. Time flies, and I’m fighting harder than anyone can imagine - physically, emotionally, and creatively.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\\n<p>Music has become both a challenge and a salvation. I’ve had to start over twice, and while progress is slow, I’m still here. I go to the gym three times a week, exercise at home, and find joy in the small victories. Despite the struggles, I’m looking forward to spring and the possibilities it might bring.</p>\\n\\n<p>Life after a stroke isn’t easy, but it’s mine.</p>","date":"2025-03-02","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/synthfreak_Writing_Music_After_a_Stroke_My_Journey_of_Redisco_be392012-eb39-48fb-925d-255ba39cdd79_0.png","imageAlt":"","socialImage":null},{"id":"6073d00d-9255-46e8-91ce-df1ec8ac9544","title":"The Black Angel: Unveiling the Toxic Legacy of Lead Pollution in Greenland","slug":"the-black-angel-unveiling-the-toxic-legacy-of-lead-pollution-in-greenland","content":"<p><strong>\\"The Black Angel\\"</strong> is more than just a song - it\'s a haunting reflection on an environmental disaster that many in Greenland still live with today. This track revisits the dark legacy of the Black Angel lead-zinc mine in Maarmorilik, which operated from 1973 to 1990, leaving a trail of pollution and health risks that continue to affect the local community.</p>\\n\\n    <p>For those of us who grew up in the region, the mine wasn’t just a distant operation - it was part of our landscape, our reality. The fjord, once pristine, was tainted by the relentless pursuit of profit. The long-term effects of lead exposure are only now fully coming to light, as the people who called this place home struggle with health complications linked to that era.</p>\\n\\n    <p>The name <strong>\\"The Black Angel\\"</strong> isn\'t just symbolic; it carries the weight of corporate greed and environmental neglect. Lead poisoning is a silent destroyer, and the track serves as a stark reminder of the cost of unchecked industrial activity.

They traveled from what is now Russia - crossing the Bering Strait - onward to Alaska, and eventually, some of them, including my own lineage, made their way to Greenland. This long, perilous migration inspires much of the imagery behind the melody, transforming it into a cinematic dreamscape that speaks of survival, triumph, and the human spirit.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Origins of the Composition</h2>\\n<p>The melody for \\"I am Nomad\\" was first created during a time when I could still play the piano with ease. Unfortunately, I lost much of my piano-playing ability after a parasitic infection in the late 1980s, which coincidentally happened around the time I was auditioning for the band Pretty Maids. Despite the setback, I continued my musical journey using different tools. Recently, I turned to EZkeys 2 software to help replicate the chords and voicings of the original piece, ensuring I could capture the song’s essence just as I had first conceived it.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Tribute to Inuit Resilience</h2>\\n<p>The main theme of \\"I am Nomad\\" is the resilience and courage of the Inuit who made that treacherous journey millennia ago. It is no small feat to survive and thrive in such harsh environments. My ancestors, as some family stories go, joined a later migration that reached Greenland around 500-1,000 years ago, while others arrived approximately 1,000 years earlier from Canada. In my dreams, I often relive the dangers of those times. There is an inexplicable familiarity with places I have never physically visited, and I sometimes wonder if these memories are preserved in our genes or carried on frequencies beyond our understanding.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Embracing Fears - and the Bears</h2>\\n<p>A recurring element in these dreams is the presence of bears. I have always had a deep-seated fear of them, yet I once found myself on a bear hunt in Alaska without any intention to kill. Strangely enough, the bears seemed to sense this - they left us alone, almost as if they understood we meant them no harm. This idea of mutual respect and connection with nature also weaves its way into the music of \\"I am Nomad,\\" especially through the use of the Inuit drum and the inclusion of original vocal techniques reminiscent of our traditional songs.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Instrumentation and Collaboration</h2>\\n<p>Originally, the melody was played solely on the piano. However, after losing my childhood friend and renowned musician Peter Leibhardt, I felt drawn to replace certain piano lines with an acoustic guitar. This decision was both emotional and practical - the piano parts were already quite demanding, and the guitar lent a warm, human touch that felt right for honoring Peter’s memory. Additionally, I used strings from Crow Hill companies\' \\"The Vault\\" series to create the layered, atmospheric backdrop. Together, the drum, acoustic guitar, and carefully arranged orchestration aim to paint a sonic picture of our ancestors’ journey and the fragile beauty of the Arctic landscapes they crossed.</p>\\n\\n<h2>From Music to Coding - A Life in Two Worlds</h2>\\n<p>Following my abrupt departure from the music scene due to my hand injury, I transitioned into a career as a hardcore coder. My work spanned a range of fields and even involved projects for the Swedish military, among other organizations worldwide. Yet, music never truly left my heart. Now at 62, revisiting \\"I am Nomad\\" feels like stepping back into a part of myself that was left behind but never lost.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Reflections on the Journey</h2>\\n<p>Today, as I continue to dream of distant tundras, formidable mountain passes, and the sounds of wolves echoing across frozen landscapes, I feel more certain than ever that \\"I am Nomad\\" is more than just a song. It is a musical time capsule that carries the spirit of our Arctic odyssey, the persistent will of our ancestors, and the profound mystery of cultural memory. Whether you are Inuit or from a completely different background, I hope that listening to \\"I am Nomad\\" offers a momentary glimpse into the grandeur, danger, and triumph that shaped not only my forebears but also the person I have become. After decades spent apart from piano, it has been a true blessing to revisit this composition and share a piece of our rich, enduring legacy.</p>\\n\\n<p>This song is dedicated to my childhood friend, Anders Samuelsen, whom we sadly lost to the sea in a boat accident - loved and never forgotten.</p>\\n","date":"2025-02-27","excerpt":"","category":"Songs","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/i-am-nomad-inuit-lars-willsen.png","imageAlt":"I am Nomad, a song about my Inuit ancestors and their long journey crossing the land bridge and all the way to Greenland","socialImage":null},{"id":"silent-strings-eternal-legacy","title":"Silent Strings Eternal Legacy - A Journey of Music and Code","slug":"silent-strings-eternal-legacy-a-journey-of-music-and-code","content":"<p>In the vibrant music scene of the 1980s, I was known as a hardrocker, sharing the stage and studio with numerous musicians who would go on to become legends. Yet, there was another side to my life, one that few knew about. While my friends and bandmates saw me as a musician, I was also deeply immersed in the world of coding, a craft I had mastered at a time when it was still a mysterious art. My expertise in 8088 and x86 processors made me a sought-after freelance coder, with companies and even the Swedish military seeking my skills to transform bulky code into efficient, compact masterpieces.</p>\\n<h2>The Dual Life of a Coder-Musician</h2>\\n<p>The 1980s were a whirlwind of music and coding. By day, I was a \\"normal\\" guy, hanging out with friends, jamming with my band, and living what seemed to be a regular life. But at night, I would retreat into the world of assembly language, crafting game engines, optimizing military software, and even dabbling in early neural networks for AI. The cover job provided by the military allowed me to delve into multimedia projects, simulating civilian infrastructure, and creating learning programs, all under the guise of a public role.</p>\\n<p>Most of my friends, especially those in Sweden, were unaware of my coding endeavors. They saw me as a multimedia enthusiast, a perception that suited me fine. It allowed me to keep my two worlds separate, even from those closest to me. This secretive life extended to my relationships; not even my girlfriends knew what I was truly working on. While the world around me was evolving, I was constantly creating, both in the realm of code and music.</p>\\n<h2>A Musician\'s Struggle and Triumph</h2>\\n<p>Throughout this period, I continued to write and produce music, pouring my soul into over 800 tracks, many of which were saved as MIDI files with accompanying lyrics. However, the bands I played with often lacked the drive I had, resulting in frustration and unmet potential. Despite the challenges, I released an album titled <em>Rootless</em>, though it never gained the distribution it deserved.</p>\\n<p>The music industry was tough, filled with prima donnas who refused to play small venues and vocalists who couldn’t write lyrics, much less speak English fluently. These obstacles led to multiple rejections from record labels, even when they initially expressed interest in our material. My passion for music was met with skepticism, both from those within the industry and from former friends who couldn’t understand how I could produce so much music so quickly.</p>\\n<h2>The Silent Saboteur</h2>\\n<p>One of the most disheartening discoveries came much later. As I released more of my music in recent years, I noticed a pattern - one of my late friends consistently disliked my tracks. This hurt, especially because I had dedicated an album to him before he passed. After his death, the dislikes stopped, confirming my suspicions. It was a painful realization that someone I had considered a friend was actively working against me, yet it didn’t deter me. I knew that my music wasn’t just for public acclaim; it was a legacy I wanted to leave for my daughter, Freya.</p>\\n<h2>Legacy of Code and Melody</h2>\\n<p>The parasitic infection that struck in the early 1990s ended my music career prematurely, rendering my fingers unable to play for over 30 years. During this time, I focused on my coding career, working with companies worldwide and contributing to projects that ranged from video games to military systems. But my love for music never faded. After recovering some use of my hands, I re-recorded the tracks from <em>Rootless</em> and released them, fulfilling a promise to myself and my daughter.</p>\\n<p>My story is one of resilience, of balancing a double life that few knew about, and of creating a legacy that will endure long after I’m gone. Despite the setbacks, the betrayals, and the physical challenges, I’ve succeeded in what matters most: leaving behind a body of work that speaks to my passion, both in music and in code. Today, as I reflect on my journey, I know that I did it all for Freya, and that is enough.</p>\\n","date":"2024-02-20","excerpt":"In the vibrant music scene of the 1980s, I was known as a hardrocker, sharing the stage and studio with numerous musicians who would go on to become l...","category":"Personal Story","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/lars-willsen-1988.png","imageAlt":"Lars Willsen in 1988","socialImage":null},{"id":"pretty-maids-audition","title":"Pretty Maids Audition - A Story of Persistence","slug":"pretty-maids-audition-a-story-of-persistence","content":"<h2>The Hospital and the Call</h2>\\n<p>In the late \'90s, I was at Nyborg hospital with swollen fingers. The doctors couldn\'t figure out why (it was later discovered to be a parasitic infection, possibly from one of my many trips to exotic parts of the world). While I was at the hospital, a nurse came and told me that someone had called, said it was important, and would call again in a quarter of an hour. The nurse brought the phone in (we didn\'t have mobile phones back then) and plugged it in. I waited for a moment before it rang. I answered the phone, and on the other end was Ken Hammer, whom I knew through Rick Hanson, with whom I had played before. During our many trips to Aarhus, where Rick lived, we often stopped by Horsens to visit Ken. We had many mutual acquaintances, but I was surprised why he was calling me while I was in the hospital; it must have been important... and it was, at least in my world. Ken asked directly, \\"How\'s it going?\\" ... \\"Hey, Lars... do you want to play with us? Allan has dropped out, and we need a keyboard player...\\" I asked, \\"When?\\" ... Ken replied, \\"Yeah, tomorrow?\\" Haha... I said I could do it once I was discharged from the hospital, and that was fine. I discharged myself to go home and go through the songs that I already knew. I had played all their songs under various circumstances, and also because I played with Rick Hanson, it was obvious to play \'Red hot &amp; heavy\' with Hammond organ. Interestingly, it was at a time when I was coding for a host of foreign companies and, on the side, writing my music (which was never recorded, but I\'ve refreshed many of them here in 2022-24). When I was ready and had rehearsed all their songs (the ones with synths, because not all have synths), I went to Horsens.</p>\\n<h2>The Attack at the train station in Horsens</h2>\\n<p>When I arrived at Horsens train station, I was attacked in the station tunnel between the platforms by two drunks, a big guy and a small annoying sidekick. He kicked out at me and called me a junkie, but I deflected the kick, dropped my keyboard, which lost a key so that it was only half attached. I then kicked the big guy right between the legs as hard as I could, sure that I busted his balls. He fell directly to the ground, clutching his balls. The little one tried again, acting like a rabid fox terrier. I blocked one of his punches and threw a punch to his throat. It was meant to go up into his nose, but he was drunk and ducked down, so I ended up hitting his throat so hard that he too was out of the picture. I grabbed my keyboard and ran up the stairs, and near the exit, I ran into an empty DSB restaurant on the right side. There was a waitress who was startled by my entrance. I quickly told her that I had been attacked and that they were probably after me. She quickly guided me behind a partition. She said that the two guys had stormed past and out into the square and that I should just stay where I was. She asked if she should call the police, but I said no because I had an audition with Pretty Maids. She looked at me, and she knew who Pretty Maids were. When the two idiots were gone, she offered to let me use their phone. I called Ken Hammer and explained that I had been attacked and was a little late. It didn\'t matter much because I was supposed to go to his apartment, and from there, we were to drive to the rehearsal room in the city.</p>\\n<h2>Preparation and Audition</h2>\\n<p>I knew all their songs since a friend introduced me to them many years earlier at Gertrud Rask\'s dormitory in Odense (he had the first album with the demons and also \'Red Hot &amp; Heavy,\' which was significantly better than the first). I think the reason they called me was that Rick Hanson had vouched for me - I played with Rick up until that time in Nyborg along with the later drummer Mike Fast, so I think Michael had also mentioned me, but it was before his time with them. I had refreshed their songs the day before, and it went okay, though I couldn\'t hear myself. As mentioned, I knew their songs well enough to play them in my sleep. When I was there, they had just recorded \'Jump the Gun\' (\'Lethal Heroes\' in the USA). The second time I went up there, I recorded the intro to \'Lethal Heroes\' on my Atari using only the JX-3P... even though the sounds weren\'t quite the same, Zumme (Paul aka. Ronnie Atkins) liked it. He listened from the hallway and came in, seemingly surprised that I had taken the time to do it, given that it was only an audition... But they called me back again; they probably had a lot of people trying out during that time. I was called in a couple more times, and during that period, Ken had moved out to a large house on Koralvej in Horsens, where I slept on his sofa. I didn\'t have a penny on me, and when Ken left to run errands in Aarhus, I had to find something to eat. I\'m not the type to rummage through people\'s things, so I grabbed a bunch of dry spaghetti and ate it raw. I know from experience that spaghetti expands after a while. I\'ve learned this from being a Greenlander without money in Denmark. When it was luxurious, they were cooked, and you got ketchup on them, and if it was really special, there was mustard too.</p>\\n<h2>The End of the Journey</h2>\\n<p>Ken drove me to the rehearsal room early because he had some errands in Aarhus, I think. Here I was, all alone in the rehearsal room without a key. In a backroom of their rehearsal space, there were tons of deposit bottles, so I thought I could allow myself to borrow a few bags. It was back when liter bottles were glass, so I filled two or three bags with them. I knew there was a supermarket nearby, but without a key, it was a bit tricky. I found a stick and set it between the door so it wouldn\'t lock and went to the store, where I bought some cigarettes (a 10-pack), some discounted cold cuts, and water. It was a bit of a gamble because if there had been thieves, they would have had free access to a lot of expensive gear - but hey, I had a good feeling, and fortunately, nothing happened. Henrik (Moorhead), the former drummer, drove me to the station so I could catch the last train to Fyn. On the train, I was in the last car and ran into some Nazi guy - at least he had a swastika on his arm, and he was pretty intrusive, grilling me about where I was from. I had an old trick from before and told him I was from Ireland (I had worked in Dublin in the early \'80s and could easily throw out some words). He bought it and then asked why I had a keyboard with me. I just casually said that I had just bought it used and didn\'t know if it worked (the key was still missing). I couldn\'t get rid of him, and then he pulled out vodka from a backpack and asked if we were going to party... sure, I said, and we sat there singing Irish drinking songs for an hour until I had to get off at Nyborg. I had to go to Horsens again after a while, and I was to attend a party being held at Ken\'s new house... I don\'t remember much from that evening/night, but I did get home. My fingers had started swelling again, so I talked to my dad about what I should do. He advised me to be honest and not put them in a situation where I might have to cancel if I joined. I then called Ken and explained that I was having the same problem as the day he called and that I unfortunately had to back out completely.

Born in <strong>Qullissat</strong>, an abandoned mining town in Greenland, and raised in <strong>Uummannaq</strong>, his music carries the weight of ancestral echoes, merging the soul of the North with the pulse of electronic soundscapes. His distinctive <strong>retro-futuristic</strong> sound draws from his deep roots in Greenland while embracing the evolution of modern synth-driven music.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Journey of Resilience & Reinvention</h2>\\n\\n<p>Lars Willsen’s musical path is one of <strong>unwavering artistic determination, survival, and reinvention</strong>. As an emerging force in the 80s <strong>hard rock and synth scene</strong>, he collaborated with numerous artists, played with <strong>Moon Jam</strong>, contributed <strong>synth solos for major bands</strong>, and was part of the <strong>Swedish band \\"Naked Truth\\"</strong>. In the fall of 1990, he even auditioned for <strong>Pretty Maids</strong>, a defining moment before fate took an unexpected turn.</p>\\n\\n<p>However, Willsen’s career was abruptly halted when a <strong>parasitic infection</strong> severely impacted his finger dexterity, forcing him into an involuntary hiatus. Though sidelined from performing, his creative fire never faded. For over <strong>30 years</strong>, he continued composing in secrecy, accumulating an archive of over <strong>800 unreleased songs</strong>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then, in 2022, <strong>defying all odds</strong>, Willsen made a triumphant return re-recording <strong>over 200 songs</strong> before suffering a <strong>stroke on December 18, 2022</strong>. Despite these hardships, he remains steadfast, proving that <strong>music, like the Arctic winds, is unstoppable</strong>.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Sonic Bridge Between Worlds</h2>\\n\\n<p>Willsen’s music is more than just sound - it’s <strong>a connection between past and future, tradition and innovation</strong>. His productions are influenced by <strong>Greenlandic landscapes, Inuit culture, and the timeless nostalgia of 80s synth music</strong>, creating a fusion that is both hauntingly beautiful and sonically groundbreaking.</p>\\n\\n<p>In the mid to late 80s, he led a <strong>secret Depeche Mode-inspired band</strong>, playing underground high school gigs. Today, his expansive discography reflects decades of experimentation, raw emotion, and an unrelenting passion for storytelling through sound.</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>\\"All my releases are to be considered my demotapes\\"</strong> – Willsen emphasizes that each track is a piece of an <strong>ever-evolving musical legacy</strong>, an <strong>aural map of his journey from the ice-covered landscapes of Greenland to the neon-lit realms of electronic music.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>\uD83D\uDD17 <strong><a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/releases\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Explore the full discography</a></strong></p>\\n","metaDescription":"Learn about Lars Willsen, a passionate musician and coder with decades of experience in both fields.
