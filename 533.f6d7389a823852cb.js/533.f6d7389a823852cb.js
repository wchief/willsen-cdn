I warned the Greenlandic government in the late 90s, again in 2001, and one last time in 2013. No reply. No action. Not even a follow-up question.</p>\\n\\n<p>The truth is, entities like the NSA have had - and still have - the ability to monitor all levels of Greenlandic government, from local mayors to the central administration (Naalakkersuisut). I showed officials just how easy it was to access their internal communications. They ignored it.</p>\\n\\n<p>Now, a former American intelligence officer is being interviewed in the media. But let me be clear - he’s part of the distraction. While he may mention a few realistic concerns, he’s steering PET and local authorities off track. This isn’t just a blind spot. It’s a deliberate blackout.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\"youtube-container\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4pOvCGwvnck\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" \\n    allowfullscreen>\\n  </iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n<h2>Subsea Cables - Our Digital Lifeline Is One Cut Away</h2>\\n\\n<p>Greenland is connected to the world through just two undersea cables - Greenland Connect and Greenland Connect North - and relies on a single data center. That’s not resilience. That’s a single point of failure. A hostile U.S. administration could exploit this setup with cyberattacks, sabotage, or political pressure. In minutes, we could be isolated.</p>\\n\\n<p>Just look at what happened to the Nord Stream pipelines or the damaged Baltic cables. This isn’t science fiction. It’s proven sabotage strategy.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Satellites and Radio - Completely Exposed</h2>\\n\\n<p>Our early-warning radars and NATO-linked systems rely on satellites - which can be jammed or spoofed. Russia already does this in Ukraine. A future U.S. government, unconstrained by alliances, could easily block our military ops, cut off surveillance, or even falsify data.</p>\\n\\n<p>Tusass, our only telecom provider, handles all radio and emergency traffic. That’s one more vulnerability just waiting to be exploited.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Greenland\'s Rare Earths - The Real Prize</h2>\\n\\n<p>Greenland holds critical resources - rare earth elements and uranium. The U.S. could use cyber-espionage to sabotage mining efforts or steal strategic data, just as China has done to competitors. They could even threaten infrastructure to pressure Denmark or Greenland into giving up control.</p>\\n\\n<p>And if chaos erupts? The U.S. could offer “help” in the form of expanded military presence. That means more U.S. boots on Arctic ground - under their control, not ours.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Internal Disloyalty - And No Consequences</h2>\\n\\n<p>Locally, we also have a serious issue - Greenlandic MAGA-style actors pushing disinformation and showing open disloyalty. They’ve actively undermined national cohesion. In other countries, that’s considered espionage. Here? Nothing has been done. These individuals still operate freely, infecting public discourse and opening the door to foreign manipulation.</p>\\n\\n<p>Why are they protected? Who benefits from their silence?</p>\\n\\n<h2>No Defensive Planning - No Contingency</h2>\\n\\n<p>Greenland has no minute-alert plan. No airport denial systems. No meaningful sea protection. Two tiny Danish ships are not a defense. There are no regional early-warning systems. No drills. No real preparation.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is not defense. This is a future occupation waiting to happen.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Denmark and PET - Complicit by Neglect</h2>\\n\\n<p>Denmark controls the hard security levers, yet has done almost nothing to prepare Greenland for modern threats. PET either lacks the mandate - or the will - to protect the island\'s interests from the U.S. or other aggressive powers.</p>\\n\\n<p>That leaves us - the people of Greenland - exposed, uninformed, and unprotected.</p>\\n\\n<h2>What Needs to Happen Now</h2>\\n\\n<p>- Redundancy now - More cables, satellite backups, and multiple secure data centers.<br>\\n- Cyber reform - Encrypt everything locally. Assume external actors already have access.<br>\\n- Monitor internal threats - Disinformation and disloyalty should be investigated and dealt with.<br>\\n- Defense plans - Prepare to defend infrastructure, delay invasions, and protect resources.</p>\\n\\n<p>This is not alarmism. It’s reality. Greenland is a strategic treasure. The world is shifting. We either wake up now - or we sleep through our own surrender.</p>\\n\\n<p>Let’s stop pretending. Let’s protect ourselves.</p>","date":"2025-05-26","excerpt":"","category":"Coding & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/Greenland Is Still Naked - A Veteran Coders Warning.png","imageAlt":"Greenland Is Still Naked - A Veteran Coder’s Warning","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"f62b38a7-5ddd-43a4-b268-31d54952b1fd","title":"Lone Hunter - A Song of Remorse, Memory, and the Echoes of Silence","slug":"lone-hunter-a-song-of-remorse-memory-and-the-echoes-of-silence","content":"<h2>The Silence That Echoes</h2>\\n<p>There are moments in life that follow us like shadows - not because we cannot escape them, but because we shouldn\'t. For many of us, childhood was a time of learning, of forming friendships, and growing through mistakes. But for some, it was marked by a silence that cut deeper than any words - the silence of standing by when someone else suffered.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Girl We Failed</h2>\\n<p><em>Lone Hunter</em> was born from such silence. This piece of music is not just a song. It is a confession. It is an open wound. It is the sound of sorrow that never found a voice until now.</p>\\n<p>There was a girl in our school - quiet, different, and alone. And like many children shaped by peer pressure, confusion, or fear, we didn\'t reach out. Not enough. Not when it mattered most. She was bullied - and not by one, but by many. And the most haunting truth is that those of us who did nothing - said nothing - are also to blame.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\"youtube-container\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hcaA105leiU\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" \\n    allowfullscreen>\\n  </iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n<h2>Five Seconds of Truth</h2>\\n<p>We were raised to be respectful. We were taught right from wrong. But teaching and action are not the same. Life moved on. Some of us were sent to Denmark, others remained. So did she. But life didn\'t move on for her - not in the way it did for the rest of us. And when I saw her again in 1984, just for five seconds outside an office building, those seconds burned through me like fire. She looked down. She didn’t meet my eyes. And in that moment, I understood the depth of what had been done - and not undone.</p>\\n\\n<h2>How Do You Say Sorry?</h2>\\n<p>How do you say sorry for something like that?</p>\\n<p>You don\'t just say it. You live it.</p>\\n<p><em>Lone Hunter</em> became my way of saying it. A call - a prayer - for the gods, the ancestors, for something greater than us, to protect her, to walk with her spirit where we could not. It is a musical guardian - a voice in the wind, asking for forgiveness where words fail. It carries not just my guilt, but the collective grief of everyone who remembers - and everyone who wishes they had done more.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Weight We Carry</h2>\\n<p>In 2015, I spoke with another girl from our class. We were in Copenhagen. I asked her - do you still remember? Her eyes told me everything before she even said a word. We all remember. Because this kind of pain doesn’t fade. It stays. And it should. It teaches.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Lesson for the Living</h2>\\n<p>To those reading this - especially the young, the parents, the teachers - bullying is not a momentary lapse. It\'s a wound. And not just for the one bullied, but for those who remain behind, carrying the weight of what they didn\'t stop. We grow up. We have children. And eventually, we find ourselves warning them not to become the very thing we once allowed.</p>\\n<p>Let <em>Lone Hunter</em> stand as more than a song. Let it be a reminder. Let it be a memorial - not only to her, but to everyone who was ever pushed aside, laughed at, or made to feel small.</p>\\n\\n<h2>For Her</h2>\\n<p>And let it be a lesson: silence is never neutral. One kind word, one hand reached out, can change the course of someone’s life. Or save it.</p>\\n<p>To the one this song is for - I don’t know if you’ll ever hear it. But it is yours. It always was.</p>\\n<p>You were never forgotten.</p>\\n<p>Dedicated to Oline Bernhardtsen, Uummannaq</p>","date":"2025-05-26","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/maxresdefault.jpg","imageAlt":"Lone Hunter - A Song of Remorse, Memory, and the Echoes of Silence","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"c777f7e2-c714-4763-b4d4-fd5c9ac65328","title":"Through the Noise: A Wake-Up Call for a Generation Lost in Illusion","slug":"through-the-noise-a-wake-up-call-for-a-generation-lost-in-illusion","content":"<h2>The Digital Vortex of Illusions</h2>\\n<p>We live in a world where reality bends at the speed of a swipe. Social media, once an innocent tool for sharing moments, has transformed into a vortex of misinformation, warped identities, and illusionary truths. From glitch-in-the-matrix videos to flat earth theories, moon landing conspiracies, and endless rabbit holes, the internet is now flooded with content that began as jokes or thought experiments but has since been misinterpreted as reality. For many young people facing uncertainty, anxiety, or loneliness, these distorted views are clung to like lifeboats.</p>\\n\\n<p>But here’s the truth: most of these ‘theories\' are entertainment packaged as belief systems, often created by individuals who profit from your engagement. They seek likes, followers, ad revenue - and they don\'t care if you\'re left questioning your sanity in the process. In a world with no consequences, where influencers stage perfect lives and online personas become idols, youth are being fed a constant diet of unrealistic expectations and disinformation.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\"youtube-container\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gh0LuMniG04\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" \\n    allowfullscreen>\\n  </iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n<h2>The New Role Models: A Mirage</h2>\\n<p>Look around. How many are chasing a Kardashian fantasy? The same bags, same makeup, same staged ‘candid\' photos. Young minds, eager to belong, adopt these personas without realizing they\'re being used. It\'s not empowerment - it\'s marketing. It\'s not authenticity - it\'s an illusion. And the cost? Identity confusion, debt, body dysmorphia, and a warped sense of self-worth based on digital approval.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Political Grift and Cult-Like Thinking</h2>\\n<p>The manipulation doesn’t stop at beauty influencers. We saw it during COVID. People with titles, publishing fake books and videos, convincing millions that science was a hoax - all for profit. Entire movements, like MAGA in the U.S., grew into cult-like followings where truth became irrelevant. People weren’t thinking critically - they were being played. And yes, even adults were vulnerable.</p>\\n\\n<p>What we\'re seeing now is not just misinformation - it\'s societal disintegration. An entire movement built on entitlement, paranoia, and resentment. A predominantly white group convinced they are the center of the world, ignoring the reality that they make up only about 10% of the global population. That kind of arrogance will not survive a world that\'s becoming increasingly united, diverse, and interconnected.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Cut the Cord</h2>\\n<p>CNN. FOX. MSNBC. YouTubers. TikTokers. Influencers. They\'re all selling something. Their job is to keep you watching, clicking, scrolling. Not informing. Not educating. Just monetizing your attention. If you\'re serious about knowing what\'s real, the first step is to cut the cord. Stop feeding the beast.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Use Your Brain: A Checklist for Reality</h2>\\n<p>Ask yourself:</p>\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Who is posting this? What do they gain?</li>\\n  <li>Is this meant to inform or to provoke?</li>\\n  <li>What is the source, and is it credible?</li>\\n  <li>Are there other perspectives?</li>\\n  <li>Does this content make you feel more afraid, more angry, or more confused? That might be the point.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Better Alternatives: Rebuilding Clarity</h2>\\n<ul>\\n  <li><strong>Get offline often</strong>: Real life doesn\'t happen through screens.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Follow independent educators</strong>: Not influencers. Seek out those committed to truth, not fame.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Read more books</strong>: Especially ones that aren\'t trying to sell you a product or idea.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Surround yourself with people who ask questions</strong>: Not ones who repeat slogans.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Practice being bored</strong>: It\'s where creativity and clarity are born.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Final Words: We Are One</h2>\\n<p>This world doesn\'t need more digital clones, rage-fueled movements, or fragile egos. It needs people who can think, feel, and live with purpose. You are not your follower count. You are not your influencer idol. And you are definitely not alone unless you choose to be.</p>\\n\\n<p>To entitled people especially: entitlement is a dangerous lie. You\'re not superior, not central, and not immune. The world is watching, and if war ever erupts on a global scale, you will not be the center - you may find yourselves isolated. So step down from the delusion and join the rest of humanity. Humble yourself. Learn. Connect.</p>\\n\\n<p>We are one.</p>\\n\\n<p>Stop scrolling.

It’s about <em>survival in the ruins of yourself</em>. About standing in the fallout of everything that was taken, everything that broke, and saying:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>You’ll die in shame by my hands.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>It’s not a threat. It’s not revenge. It’s <em>resistance</em>. It’s that final stand we all take - not against someone else, but against the versions of ourselves that tried to give up. It’s the scream from the shadows, the refusal to go quietly.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Loner</em> doesn’t ask for sympathy. It offers a mirror. You’ll see what you’ve tried to forget. The war behind the smile. The fire behind the silence.</p>\\n\\n<p>I never stuck to one genre - my music walks across emotional landscapes. This one? It walks the frostbitten plains of Greenland, the silence of childhood, the echo of voices that should’ve never been silenced.

Not in the traditional sense. For me, songwriting isn\'t about planning or plotting - it\'s something I stumble upon. A chord catches my ear, I add another, and if it clicks, a verse appears. Usually I leap straight into the chorus, humming or mumbling dummy words just to feel where it wants to go. Only later do I find the theme. It always depends on the feel, the mood, the atmosphere of that particular moment.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Early Days in Uummannaq</h2>\\n<p>Sometimes, rarely, I already have the idea. But most of my music happens in real time, in random bursts of inspiration. This method has stayed with me since the 70s, when I was still living in my hometown of Uummannaq. After school, a few of us would get together with guitars - me with a beautiful 6-string nylon and a 12-string that didn’t survive the Arctic climate (12-strings often snap their necks in that dry, unforgiving air). We were just kids, but already writing songs like we were born to it. Music came naturally to us.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\"youtube-container\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0Y7mB6nFjL0\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" \\n    allowfullscreen>\\n  </iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n<h2>Learning Without Knowing</h2>\\n<p>One of my closest friends back then had siblings who played in bands. Their boyfriends were musicians too, and every now and then, they\'d show us new chords. We didn’t know the names - sus2, sus4, 6ths, 7ths, 9ths - but we knew how they sounded. We learned from each other, constantly growing.</p>\\n\\n<h2>When Politics Got Personal</h2>\\n<p>But something strange happened. We weren’t allowed to play at school events anymore. We were confused. Only later in life did I find out that some teachers held grudges - not against us, but against someone in our little group - and used us as political pawns. Children caught in the crossfire of adult resentment. It broke something inside us.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Peter’s Last Words</h2>\\n<p>Years later, in 2013, I visited Peter - my old friend, now dying of cancer in a Copenhagen hospital. We hadn\'t seen each other in nearly 30 years. He told me something shocking, something I promised to keep secret. But I can share this much: Peter was special. A one-of-a-kind musician. After his death, I tried to make a documentary to honor him. That too was sabotaged - not by strangers, but by people close to his family. No names, no blame, but one person I will mention: \\"<a href=\\"https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juaaka_Lyberth\\" target=\\"_blank\\">Juaaka Lyberth</a>\\"\\n. When I reached out to him - someone from our own hometown - he ignored me completely. As if Peter’s story wasn’t worth telling.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Making Good on a Promise</h2>\\n<p>Peter said to me, “Make sure you get your music out. At some point it’ll be too late.” I promised. But I didn’t follow through until 2022, almost a decade later. I figured, if this is the spirit in my home country - indifference and silence - then fine. I’ll overdo it. I’ll release everything.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Archive Awakens</h2>\\n<p>Of the more than 800 songs I had written, I’ve only managed to re-record around 200 so far. Almost 20 albums, 10 EPs, and countless singles. Still rolling. Still ignored by the same people who once knew me. I have theories why, but it doesn’t matter anymore. It\'s not about them - it’s about the music. It’s about the truth.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Song That Lived On</h2>\\n<p>Peter’s song ‘Eqillutit\' has roots in a chorus we wrote together, along with Frederik Nielsen. If you listen closely, you’ll hear the same DNA in my instrumental track Uummannaq. We didn’t fight over credits - we were in it together. That spirit remains in everything I do.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The MIDI Years</h2>\\n<p>In the 80s, I drifted toward piano-based compositions, all done with MIDI and synths. Parallel to my time in hard rock bands. Those tracks were never released - some may have been claimed by others, which is fine. But I wrote so many songs, I had to preserve them somehow. I bought an Atari, got a beta copy of Cubase (still have the cartridges), and backed it all up. For decades it sat in my mother’s cellar, untouched. In 2022, I finally transferred everything to a hard drive. MIDI files, lyrics, even SysEx data from my old synths. The 800 songs? Now over 1,200.</p>\\n\\n<h2>New Chapters</h2>\\n<p>Of course, I can\'t re-record them all. So I moved on. Started writing new material. At first, I didn’t know what genre to pursue. Eventually I settled into storytelling - simple songs with strong themes that my female vocalist could bring to life. We kept most songs in their original keys, even when it caused a few headaches. What I release now are essentially my demos. Not because I need demos - but because every song is part of the bigger picture.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Fluke Question</h2>\\n<p>People sometimes ask, “Why so many songs?” As if it’s a problem. The answer is simple: I write quickly. Once I have a hook, it’s done. And on top of all that, I’ve done musicals too. But if you ask around, the gossip would say I’ve done nothing. That I talk too much. That I’m full of it.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Proving Them Wrong</h2>\\n<p>So I changed that. Permanently. Go check for yourself. Tons of releases on every streaming service. Am I a fluke? Or not?</p>\\n\\n<h2>It Was Always for Her</h2>\\n<p>I started writing most of this music as a teenager. I just ran into a lot of people and problems. But I’ve played in bands, auditioned for legends, jammed with some of the greats - and I’m not stopping here. No one gets to gatekeep my output anymore.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Legacy, Not Approval</h2>\\n<p>I’m doing this for one reason: to document my youth. To leave a trail for my daughter. Every song, even if it doesn’t sound like it, was written for her. For my children’s future. Now she’s 23. She can point and say, “That’s my dad. Look at all that music. It’s everywhere.”</p>\\n\\n<h2>Mission Accomplished</h2>\\n<p>Cool.

Musicians are paid next to nothing per stream, the algorithm favors already-famous artists, and pay-to-play playlist culture is killing organic discovery. For independent creators, Spotify offers exposure - but not sustainability.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAdd to this a sea of generic playlists, opaque editorial systems, and corporate ownership of the charts - and the cracks in the castle walls are clear. Spotify isn’t built for artists or even for serious listeners anymore - it’s built to maintain its grip on an aging business model.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Why AI - Not Music AI, But Platform AI - Changes Everything</h2>\\n<p>\\nThe AI revolution isn’t just about generating songs - it’s about building smarter, fairer platforms. Coders, musicians, and visionaries are already using AI to build everything Spotify isn\'t: transparent, artist-centric platforms with direct revenue models, better discovery systems, smarter analytics, and built-in tools for community and fan engagement.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nImagine a platform where AI doesn’t feed you corporate hits, but helps you *discover* hidden gems based on your actual taste. A space where artists control their rights, set their own pricing, track real-time engagement, and automate everything from promotion to audience growth. This isn’t theoretical - it\'s already happening.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Labels Will Collapse - And We Should Let Them</h2>\\n<p>\\nRecord labels like Sony, Universal, and Warner have long acted as bottlenecks in music. They control catalogs, manipulate charts, and lock artists into outdated contracts. But AI-driven, decentralized platforms are making them irrelevant. Why would a new artist sign away their rights, when they can launch their career with smart tools and keep everything?\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAI-powered tools can handle contract generation, royalty tracking, licensing, distribution, marketing, and even legal protections - all automatically. Labels become middlemen in a world that doesn’t need them. Their power fades not with a bang, but with irrelevance.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>This Is the Ticket Out for Musicians</h2>\\n<p>\\nFor artists, this is liberation. No more streaming pennies. No more giving away 85% of your income. The next wave of platforms - built with AI and artist-first thinking - will allow direct monetization through tokenized ownership, NFTs, live session tips, and smart contracts. Fans can pay artists directly, without an empire in between.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nMusicians can manage careers like entrepreneurs - with AI handling everything tedious, from email campaigns to accounting. That frees up time for what matters: music and connection. The tools to do this exist. The only thing missing is mass migration.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The New Platforms Are Coming - And You Can Help Build Them</h2>\\n<p>\\nWhat’s needed now is not just user support, but participation. Coders, UX designers, musicians, strategists - everyone with a stake in music’s future can help build these alternatives. They won’t look like Spotify. They’ll look more like ecosystems: modular, artist-owned, and fueled by transparency and creativity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nA handful of prototypes already show the way. AI helps route music to the right ears, gives creators deep insights into their audience, and automates engagement without needing social media slavery. These tools let music grow without gatekeepers.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Why Spotify - And the Old Guard - Can’t Keep Up</h2>\\n<p>\\nSpotify has no incentive to change. Their model depends on ads, corporate playlists, and label deals.

It\'s a narrow lens, and it has hurt generations of us who grew up carrying the weight of someone else\'s assumptions.</p>\\n\\n<p>I noticed the difference when I moved to Sweden in the 90s. Swedes, while distant in their knowledge of Greenland, didn’t hold the same loaded image. They had their own challenges, worse in some ways, but the prejudice wasn’t the same. And perhaps because they had the Sami - a native people who, like us, are deeply tied to nature - there was a kind of quiet, indirect understanding.</p>\\n\\n<p>Back home as kids, we had TV through bootlegged cassettes with Swedish subtitles. That’s how we learned the language. But real-life Sweden was harder than subtitles. It took time, but eventually I found friends, learned the culture, and adapted. That said, this story isn\'t about Sweden - it’s about the weight we carried long before.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Boarding School Years</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the 70s, I was shipped to Denmark with 50 other Greenlandic kids to attend a boarding school specifically for us. We were completely isolated from Danish society. The older students had already picked up bad habits from the year before - they taught us where to get cannabis, alcohol, and how to hide it all. It was never part of our northern culture. I later realized how trauma and hallucinogens don’t mix well. We needed guidance, not exile. We were thrown into an arena with no tools - no mentors, no shield.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Struggle for Acceptance</h2>\\n\\n<p>The hostility from Danish society was the biggest shock. It wasn\'t always overt, but it was constant. We had to be twice as good to be half as accepted. In music, in school - in life - we were never good enough in their eyes. High school was where it all hit hardest. I was already writing musicals and had a reputation among my peers for being a creator. But the Greenlandic musicians from Nuuk, who would later join famous bands like G-60 and Rasmus Lyberth’s band, looked down on me. They only spoke Danish and acted like they weren’t Greenlandic. That rejection cut deeper than the Danish one.</p>\\n\\n<p>I tried to join the school band. No explanation why they wouldn’t let me. My music teacher already had his bias. He saw me once rehearsing with two girls who sang beautifully. But nothing I did was enough. Even my late-50s Gibson guitar wasn’t \\"good enough\\" because it had a custom paint job. I wasn’t a brand snob - someone had gifted me that guitar because they believed in me. Later, I burned it. It carried too many bad memories.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Alone with the Music</h2>\\n\\n<p>No matter how good we were, we were still just \\"drunken natives\\" in their eyes. Even the Greenlandic girls distanced themselves, ashamed to be seen as \\"savages.\\" I kept making music alone. I wrote hundreds of songs - from pain, from trauma, from the isolation. I kept them to myself. Any time I shared something, I was slapped down with, \\"You Greenlanders can\'t be this good.\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>The tracks on my channel and the streaming platforms - most are demos from back then. Even after not touching an instrument for over 30 years, I still remembered them. Thanks to my Atari ST 1040fm and Cubase, I saved everything in MIDI. That’s how much it mattered.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Breaking Through and Being Shut Out</h2>\\n\\n<p>Even when I got close to joining big names like Pretty Maids, the same skepticism returned: \\"You can’t be in a hard rock band as a Greenlander.\\" (Not from the band - they were professional, fair - but from the people around.) Then I got hit by a parasite infection that ruined my hand. That ended my music career for over three decades.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Return</h2>\\n\\n<p>But now, I’m back - re-recording everything. The deniers have gone silent. They act like they don’t know me. Maybe it hurts to watch someone they dismissed shine while their own careers fade. So I leaned in - exaggerated the output. Released nearly 20 albums, over 10 EPs, countless singles. I even removed many of them. Still not enough. Never good enough.</p>\\n\\n<p>Not even my own people are in the listener stats - Greenland is barely on the map. That’s the bitter irony: I proved them all wrong, and still, they find new excuses. After all, I’m only a Greenlander.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Pride in Identity</h2>\\n\\n<p>But maybe that’s exactly why I do this.</p>\\n\\n<p>Because being only a Greenlander is already more than enough.</p>\\n\\n<p>I am a very proud Greenlander. I speak the language fluently and still carry the original dialect of the 70s. It’s in my voice, my identity, and my music - and no one can take that away from me.</p>\\n","date":"2025-05-21","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Personal","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/only-a-greenlander.png","imageAlt":"Only a Greenlander","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"8bdfa365-8f7c-4078-9d6a-009dbd222278","title":"I Use AI Art - Because My Brain Is Damaged, Not My Creativity","slug":"i-use-ai-art-because-my-brain-is-damaged-not-my-creativity","content":"<h2>I Used to Be a Real Artist</h2>\\n<p>\\nLet me start with a fact: I used to be a visual artist. Not just playing around in Photoshop, but creating full-blown artwork for major magazines, world tours, and print campaigns - including covers you’ve likely seen without ever knowing I was behind them. I spent decades building a visual language, mastering tools, and contributing to the industry in a very real way.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThen I had a stroke.  \\nA massive one.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt shattered my brain.  \\nMy memory isn’t what it was. My ability to work for long stretches is gone. The mental bandwidth required to do what I once did - just isn’t there anymore. But the will is. The creative spark still lives.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>No, AI Didn’t Replace My Art - It Gave It Back</h2>\\n<p>\\nWhen people throw opinions around about AI art - that it’s \\"lazy\\", \\"stealing\\", or \\"soulless\\" - they’re usually coming from a place of ignorance or fear. And while yes, some people do abuse AI tools (just like anything else), not everyone’s out here trying to con the world.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSome of us are just trying to function again.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAI imaging gave me something I didn’t know I could have again: a creative outlet. A way to turn emotions into visuals without needing ten hours of focused screen time. I still guide the image. I choose the theme, the mood, the look. I refine prompts the way I once refined brush strokes. It’s still me - just with a different kind of tool.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Outsourcing? On $50 a Month?</h2>\\n<p>\\nPeople have even approached me saying I should \\"support real artists\\" by outsourcing my visuals. I get the sentiment, but let’s be real - when you’re surviving on less than $50 a month, the luxury of hiring a designer for every single blog post is just not in the cards. This isn\'t about taking work away from anyone. This is about survival - mentally, creatively, financially.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nI’ve done the work. I’ve been part of the “real” industry. I paid my dues. You want to dig through history? You’ll find my fingerprints all over design work from the past three decades - from mainstream to niche to underground.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>What AI Actually Means for Me</h2>\\n<p>\\nTo be absolutely clear:\\n</p>\\n<ul>\\n  <li>My blog states whether an image is a photo or AI-generated.</li>\\n  <li>My music is not AI-generated.</li>\\n  <li>Every song you hear was written by me, played on piano or acoustic guitar, and developed like any traditional songwriter would. I can still sing. I can still play. I just need help remembering. Again - brain damage.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>\\nAI helps me bridge the gap between what I can do now and what I used to do. It’s not a shortcut - it’s an enabler.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>If You’ve Never Lost Your Mind, You Might Not Understand</h2>\\n<p>\\nIt’s easy to judge from the outside. It’s easy to preach when your cognitive functions are intact. But try waking up and forgetting how to finish a sentence. Try sitting in front of a blank canvas and realizing you can’t push through the hours anymore.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAI isn’t a gimmick to me.  \\nIt’s a lifeline.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nSo before you throw around words like \\"fake artist\\" or \\"AI cheat\\", maybe ask why someone’s using it in the first place. You might be surprised to learn that behind that AI-generated image - there’s a real story, and a real artist, still fighting to stay connected to the world they love.\\n</p>","date":"2025-05-21","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/full_collage.png","imageAlt":"I Use AI Art - Because My Brain Is Damaged, Not My Creativity","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"c6307b5d-b922-4956-b3cf-83ab721d4e8d","title":"The Grunge Illusion - How Spoiled Snobs Pretending to Be Broken Nearly Killed Rock","slug":"the-grunge-illusion-how-spoiled-snobs-pretending-to-be-broken-nearly-killed-rock","content":"<h2>Hard Rock Was the Voice of the Streets - Grunge Was Designer Dirt</h2>\\n<p>\\nIn the early to mid-90s, a strange transformation gripped the rock world. What had once been a celebration of musicianship, power, rebellion, and working-class grit was suddenly painted as obsolete - even embarrassing. Grunge had arrived, and with it came a cultural rewrite that swept away decades of authenticity in favor of something manufactured to look “real.”\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut for many of us - musicians, fans, survivors of actual working-class struggles - the grunge explosion felt like a hostile takeover, carried out by a new elite dressed in flannel and armed with manufactured misery. They weren’t rebelling against a system that oppressed them - they were rebelling against the music world that gave them everything, while pretending to be what they were not.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Industry’s Sudden Betrayal</h2>\\n<p>\\nThe speed of the shift was ruthless. Radio stopped playing metal overnight. Magazines that once put guitar heroes on their covers were suddenly mocking them. MTV - once a megaphone for hard rock - turned its back and embraced the new dreariness. Labels chased the “next Nirvana” and dumped anything with distortion and melody that wasn’t drenched in self-pity.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nI remember hearing about Pretty Maids playing small shows with fewer than 50 people and a weak sound guy. Just a decade earlier, they were auditioning guitarists for serious tours. Now, they were treated like yesterday’s news. It wasn’t because they’d gotten worse - it was because the industry had become ashamed of music that didn’t wallow in despair.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWe weren’t ashamed. We came from that struggle. We earned those chords, those solos, that volume.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>My Personal View - The Hard Rock Depression</h2>\\n<p>\\nI wasn’t even playing music during that time. I had stepped away. But I <em>felt</em> the depression in the hard rock world like a dark cloud hanging over everything. It was more than a genre shift - it was an identity crisis. For those of us who came from the real working class - not some curated suburban angst - it was devastating to see what was happening.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nYounger people were impossible to communicate with. The change wasn’t just musical - it was cultural. They were so damn stubborn they couldn’t even see the front of their own noses. You couldn’t tell them anything. If it wasn’t mumbled and miserable, it wasn’t worth hearing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThere was a growing disrespect - not just for the music, but for the generations who lived it, built it, <em>earned</em> it. And it wasn’t born of rebellion - it was born of delusion.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Pearl Jam Tragedy - A Turning Point or a Distraction?</h2>\\n<p>\\nIn June 2000, during Pearl Jam’s set at the Roskilde Festival in Denmark, nine fans were crushed to death in a crowd surge. It was a tragedy - no question. The event shocked the rock world, and Pearl Jam was never the same afterward.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut some of us couldn’t help but feel a bitter irony. Here was a band that had become a symbol of the grunge movement’s emotional manipulation - standing on a stage, headlining one of Europe’s biggest festivals, when their audience collapsed under the weight of something far darker than music. The tragedy led to sweeping changes in festival safety, but the moment felt like a metaphor - that this movement, built on feigned chaos and aesthetic misery, finally consumed its own.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nWould grunge have faded sooner if this hadn’t happened? Maybe. Its cultural fire was already burning low. But the Roskilde tragedy gave the movement a new depth - a martyrdom - and in doing so, extended the myth. A myth that had already outlived its authenticity.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Cobain’s Suicide - The Myth Machine</h2>\\n<p>\\nWhen Kurt Cobain took his own life in 1994, the world stopped. His death was tragic. But his image - a rich kid in dirty jeans with a shotgun - was instantly sanctified. His misery was transformed into gospel. His disillusionment became a blueprint. And just like that, the spoiled discontent of a generation became a badge of honor.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nNever mind that Cobain lived a life many of us could only dream of. He had fame, fortune, and freedom. But he couldn’t handle it. He was surrounded by people who said “yes” to everything - yet his art was treated as sacred truth. And millions of fans - many of whom came from real pain, real war, real abandonment - were told this was the only truth that mattered.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Global Fallout - and the Rise of Delusional Youth</h2>\\n<p>\\nAs the internet bloomed, American grunge culture infected youth across the globe. Suddenly, everyone wanted to be a disaffected loner. The old music - built on craft, sweat, and dignity - was dismissed as “fake.” Young people forgot that there was power in rising above pain, not just wallowing in it. Being strong was now seen as posturing. Being loud meant you were insecure. Smiling meant you were selling out.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt was never just about the music. It was about values. And those values were flipped upside down.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nIt’s no coincidence that this cultural shift mirrors some of today’s worst trends - from glorified victimhood to self-serving populist movements. Grunge wasn’t MAGA - but both were symptoms of a culture that mistook acting broken for being real.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>But Rock Didn’t Die - We Just Had to Wait</h2>\\n<p>\\nBy the late 2000s, something started to shift. People remembered. They dug up old records. They discovered bands that had been buried in the 90s. And slowly, without help from the media, hard rock and metal began to rise again.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe music didn’t change - the audience did. People got tired of pretending. Tired of being sad just to fit in. Tired of lies wrapped in fuzz pedals and flannel. Bands like Pretty Maids are now being rediscovered. Legacy festivals are full again. Vinyl is back. And so is pride in what we built before the storm.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Final Word</h2>\\n<p>\\nGrunge was not a rebellion. It was a detour. A deeply American identity crisis dressed up as authenticity and sold to the world. And the world bought it.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut those of us who lived through it - who played through it - who watched friends and legends be silenced - we never forgot. We never stopped playing. And we’re still here.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe storm passed. The music endured.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAnd the truth? That was never theirs to tell.\\n</p>\\n","date":"2025-05-20","excerpt":"","category":"Music & History","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/grunge-era\'.png","imageAlt":"The Grunge Illusion - How Spoiled Snobs Pretending to Be Broken Nearly Killed Rock","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"aeea1e9c-ca81-495a-87f2-71db00342893","title":"Returning to the Strings - A Summer Rehearsal Plan","slug":"returning-to-the-strings-a-summer-rehearsal-plan","content":"<h2>Returning to the Strings - A Summer Rehearsal Plan</h2>\\n<p>Most of my music was born on an acoustic guitar - late nights, quiet mornings, beaches, and campfires.

I was back home in Nyborg, Denmark - visiting my mom. At the time, I was working on a highly confidential coding project in Sweden. Most people around knew me from the days when I played with <em>Nam Dihn</em> - a hard rock band I was in for a few years. Amazing guitarist. Killer drummer. But that’s a story for another day.</p>\\n\\n<H2>The Night Out</H2>\\n<p>We were out one night - a bar, some drinks, the usual. I didn’t notice him at first, but apparently, one guy had a problem with me. Maybe it was the long hair. Maybe something else. What he didn’t seem to realize was that most of the people around me were old friends. Loyal ones.</p>\\n\\n<p>Out of nowhere, this guy grabs my hair and starts dragging me toward the door.</p>\\n\\n<p>Big mistake.</p>\\n\\n<p>What he didn’t expect was how quickly my friends reacted. They flew in - pulled him off me - and dragged him outside. One of them came back and asked me if I wanted a 1-on-1 fight with him. I said no.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then - just as they let him go - I jumped him. Quick and clean. He didn’t expect it, and neither did my friends. I bent his arm back - over the elbow - until it made a sound no joint should make. Then I let him go. No need for more.</p>\\n\\n<H2>A Line Crossed</H2>\\n<p>We all went back inside - except for one of my friends. A biker. He stayed outside and gave the guy a real beating. So much so that the police showed up.</p>\\n\\n<p>When they asked who did it, I raised my hand. I told them he went for me first.</p>\\n\\n<p>What I didn’t realize was just how bad my friend had finished the guy off after I’d gone back in. I had no idea. The guy couldn’t even walk.</p>\\n\\n<p>The cops took me to the station. The young officer looked at me like he knew I wasn’t telling the full story - but he logged it. I spent the night in custody.</p>\\n\\n<H2>The Courtroom</H2>\\n<p>Next morning, I faced a judge. My lawyer - a real hotshot - told me to claim self-defense. Luckily, the bartender had seen it all - saw that the guy had dragged me by my hair. When they brought the guy in (in a wheelchair, no less), he admitted he started it. Said it was his fault.</p>\\n\\n<p>Still, the judge looked at me and said:<br>\\n<strong>\\"You can\'t run around and beat up people like that.\\"</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I replied: <strong>\\"I was defending myself. Maybe I overreacted a bit.\\"</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>I got time - not much - and served it in an open prison. I was okay with it. My biker friend came to visit and said, <em>“I owe you.”</em><br>\\nI told him, <em>“No you don’t.”</em></p>\\n\\n<H2>Inside the Prison</H2>\\n<p>The other inmates? They saw him roll in on a motorcycle and figured I must be someone not to mess with. They kept their distance. Some didn’t even look me in the eye.</p>\\n\\n<p>Weird stuff happened at night, but I stayed alert. I didn’t need to worry long. A new guy arrived. Turned out he was sent by my friend - instructed to watch over me 24/7. We ended up in the same room with 11 others. I never forgot that. I was lucky to have friends like that.</p>\\n\\n<p>I helped that guy later, too - some <em>alternative coding</em> for a personal matter involving his daughter. No hesitation.</p>\\n\\n<H2>The Release</H2>\\n<p>On my last day, I was released with a few others. One big guy started acting tough on the transport to Silkeborg. His friend whispered something to him about <em>my</em> friends - he backed off fast.</p>\\n\\n<p>I returned to Sweden right away. Luckily, it all happened during my month off.</p>\\n\\n<p>But I did go to my boss and tell him the truth. He thanked me for being honest and even asked the Danish police for the file. That’s when I found out - they’d placed me where they did to <strong>protect me</strong>. The official record called it self-defense.</p>\\n\\n<p>Later, that same guy - the one who dragged me out by my hair - made headlines. He was sentenced to <strong>life</strong> in Asia for murder. I guess the judge saw something in him that I didn’t.</p>\\n\\n<H2>Final Word</H2>\\n<p>Let me be clear:</p>\\n\\n<p><strong>I didn’t start it.<br>\\nI didn’t want it.<br>\\nBut I ended it.</strong></p>\\n\\n<p>He grabbed me.

Others, like me, are forged in the fire of things kids shouldn’t have to witness. And that changes you - not just on the surface, but deep inside your wiring. It makes you act, see, and sense the world in ways others don’t. It also makes some people uncomfortable.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Signs Were Always There</h2>\\n<p>From an early age, I noticed the signs life was giving me. I learned to read people - prima donnas in music, girlfriends with patterns, friends who wore masks. I saw what was coming. Many people don\'t. And worse, they don\'t want to. They follow some bizarre playbook of denial - and when you don’t play along, you become the problem in their eyes.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Judged for the Family Name</h2>\\n<p>I was treated differently from the start. School inspectors acted like they had authority over my soul - not because of what I’d done, but because of which family I came from. One of those so-called inspectors became a politician later, the kind of guy who yells at you for “dwelling on the past.” Only guilty people say that. The past teaches. Denying it is how history repeats itself.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Human Nature Doesn’t Change</h2>\\n<p>You can’t ignore human nature. It doesn’t change. And if you pretend otherwise, you’re just easy prey for the same cycles of abuse and failure we’ve seen a thousand times before.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Violence, Cowards, and Truth</h2>\\n<p>Where I grew up, things could get violent - fast. I was shot at as a kid by drunk, delusional men who couldn’t handle their own wrecked lives. My mother was a judge, and in a tight-knit place where everyone’s someone’s cousin, that brought both respect and trouble. The ones who hated us? They didn’t have the guts to face what they’d done, so they blamed the judge’s kids. Cowards with fists and broken souls.</p>\\n\\n<h2>I Never Backed Down</h2>\\n<p>But I didn’t back down. Not even from men twice my size. Not even when they tried to break into our house while my father was overseas handling international affairs. Something told me that Saturday night would be different. I had that feeling again - not just intuition. Something deeper. I’ve had it since I was a kid, since the day I decided fear wasn’t going to own me anymore.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Prepared for War</h2>\\n<p>I loaded my dad’s .38 rifle, just in case. I set up a .22 with a full mag and spares. I hid a shotgun behind coats near the entry. When they came, I was ready. I didn’t wait. I fired through the main door. They never came back. And I went to school the next morning like nothing had happened. That’s the kind of kid I was. Not because I wanted to be - but because life demanded it.</p>\\n\\n<h2>No More Fear</h2>\\n<p>From that moment on, I was done with fear. I’d seen the worst of people, and I knew what survival required. Many of my friends had no clue what that meant. Some had it rough in other ways, sure - but few carried that kind of weight before they turned 8.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Calling It Like It Is</h2>\\n<p>Later, in music and life, I had no tolerance for negativity. In bands, I called things out directly. If someone showed repeat patterns in a relationship, I cut it short - on the spot. I didn’t waste time on people who thought the world owed them something.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Secret Life</h2>\\n<p>And while they played their little games, I worked silently. In the shadows. Coding for the Swedish military. Advanced systems, weapon tech - things people didn’t even think I could pull off. I let them talk. I stuck to my “official” story. Nobody knew who I really was until 2021, when I decided it was time to tell the truth. That I had been someone. That the rumors weren’t myths - they were chapters waiting to be published.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Legacy, Not Revenge</h2>\\n<p>I didn’t come back to prove anything to the doubters.

I brought with me a canoe, a backpack, and the simple plan of spending a week relaxing, paddling through lakes and falls, and eventually making my way down to \xd6stersund.</p>\\n\\n<p>I had to register with the local canoe rentals, and they drove me to the starting point, north of Hotagen Lake. Already that first late night, I saw brown bears, moose, and other wildlife - so I found a tiny island close to the shore, full of trees, which seemed safer in case a curious bear wandered by. I’m not afraid of bears, but I’d hate to be surprised in my tent.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Waterfall and rescue</h2>\\n<p>The next day, I reached a pretty hefty waterfall - a foss. It looked intense, but I made it through without complications. I had a life vest (one I acquired from a SAS plane in the early 80s - auto inflatable), so I wasn’t too worried. I soon found another small rocky island, set up my tent, and started a fire. Not long after, I heard yelling - in Danish, of all languages.</p>\\n\\n<p>I quickly put out the fire, jumped into my canoe, and paddled around a corner. About half a mile away, I saw three people - two in the water, the third on a rock, clearly exhausted. Their backpacks were floating away, and their canoe had broken into two pieces, though it was still loosely holding together.</p>\\n\\n<p>I acted fast. Got them one by one into my canoe, dropped them off on land, and then paddled out to collect their gear. The bags were light - military issue. Once I had everything secured, I told them I had a safe setup further down the river at a huge lake. They could walk through the woods while I paddled ahead with their packs.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Fire, shelter, and a story</h2>\\n<p>Back at my camp, I re-lit the fire in two protected spots with smaller rocks and waited. About an hour later, they reached the shore. I pushed the canoe toward them, one at a time, using a rope leash. Once they were over, I helped them warm up by the fires. They had a military tent, soaked but well-made - we shook it out and helped it dry. I gave them spare gym pants and thermal leggings, and helped gather small branches to place under their tent floor. They stepped on them to crush them flat before putting their sleeping mats on top - a trick I had learned.</p>\\n\\n<p>They warmed up fast and told me they were from the elite Danish army corps - on a survival training mission. So there I was - a young Greenlander with long dark hair - helping elite soldiers survive in the Swedish wild. I couldn’t help but smile. I told them about a family member from generations back who was part of a polar expedition. He survived while others didn’t and wrote crucial notes explaining what happened - knowing he wouldn’t make it, but his words would.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Morning and parting ways</h2>\\n<p>They listened closely. The guys had a bottle of vodka they’d picked up in \xd6stersund. I told them to save it for the night - it would get cold - and chocolate would be better to keep the body burning calories. They soon fell asleep. I stayed up a few more hours watching the fires before heading into my tent.</p>\\n\\n<p>The next morning, while they still slept, I gathered wood and restarted both fires. I boiled some water from a nearby river that flowed down from the mountains. When the sun rose, they joined me by the shore, planning to walk to Laxviken at the southern end of the lake - a few miles, but really more like triple that if you followed the shoreline.</p>\\n\\n<p>Later that day, I reached Laxviken by canoe. The locals told me the soldiers had been picked up by a car - and they’d told them about “a Greenlander in the woods.”</p>\\n\\n<h2>New visitors from Polar Studios</h2>\\n<p>I pitched my tent right in the middle of the village near the lake - at some sort of lookout point - and spent the night there.</p>\\n\\n<p>The next day, three people arrived in a bigger canoe. They were from Stockholm - on a “survival” trip, though it looked more like a party. Red-faced and exhausted, they were happy when I told them, “Plenty of space here.” They set up their tent next to mine.</p>\\n\\n<p>These guys had crates of beer, food, and gear. We ended up talking all night. Turned out they were from Polar Studios - ABBA’s legendary studio. Engineers and assistants. They’d been sent out to cool off after weeks of intense sessions. I don’t remember who they’d been working with, but I do remember them telling me how ABBA built their layered vocals - 2nd and 3rd voices, little tricks I kept with me.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Marie and the echoes of Sweden</h2>\\n<p>In fact, I used that very trick on my track <em>Marie</em>, from the <em>To Sweden</em> EP - funny how those ideas show up years later. I wrote <em>Marie</em> in the mid-90s, a decade after that trip. You can listen to it here: <a href=\\"https:\\\\/\\\\/www.youtube.com\\\\/watch?v=51jkZ-rXN0E\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">Marie – YouTube</a></p>\\n\\n<p>The song is about a dear friend I met while working in Sweden. She and her boyfriend took great care of me during my time off. <em>Marie</em> also appears on my album <em>Last Flight from Arlanda</em> - available on most streaming platforms.</p>\\n\\n<h2>One trip, many memories</h2>\\n<p>I ran into the soldiers again in \xd6stersund later. They were heading north, bound for another survival training session - possibly in the Arctic.</p>\\n\\n<p>That trip is one I’ll never forget.  \\nI saved three elite soldiers, learned studio secrets from the ABBA crew, and paddled through some of Sweden’s wildest nature - not bad for one young Greenlander with a canoe.</p>","date":"2025-05-14","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/hotagen-abba-1984.png","imageAlt":"The Summer I Saved Elite Soldiers and Learned ABBA’s Vocal Tricks","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"4d633f84-bf98-4771-9baf-3f4a2b9603df","title":"51 Untamed Solos – Synths & Strings from the Soul of Lars Willsen (1980s Spirit)","slug":"51-untamed-solos-synths-strings-from-the-soul-of-lars-willsen-1980s-spirit","content":"<h2>Introduction</h2>\\n<p>There’s a moment between impulse and thought - that fragile spark where music just <em>happens</em>.

To Output. To Roland. And to a handful of others whose inboxes I’ve long since given up hope on. Not once - but several times over.</p>\\n\\n<p>And what did I get in return?</p>\\n\\n<p>Silence.</p>\\n\\n<p>Not a single reply. Not even an automated “thanks.”</p>\\n\\n<p>This isn’t just about ignored emails. This is about how the music tech industry treats real musicians: with indifference. If you’re not a trending influencer, an award-winning name they can piggyback off, or a walking affiliate code - you\'re invisible.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Where Did the Soul Go?</h2>\\n\\n<p>These companies used to be about sound. Innovation. Experimentation. Now? They’re about launches. Press kits. Controlled hype.</p>\\n\\n<p>A new product drops, and like clockwork, a chorus of YouTubers uploads near-identical demos - all posted the same hour, all clearly briefed and paid to make noise.</p>\\n\\n<p>But it’s just that - noise.</p>\\n\\n<p>I’ve lived through the <em>real</em> synth era. Jupiter-8, OB-Xa, Moogs, TX812s, DX7s, JX-3Ps, Korg samplers. I know how a patch comes alive. I know what “analog” actually means - and no, it’s not just an oscillator with some filters and an envelope.</p>\\n\\n<p>Younger generations are sold on the myth that “analog” is a style, a look, a YouTube thumbnail. It’s not. It’s circuitry, voltage, feel. And unless your computer is running the actual circuits - not emulating them - it’s not analog.</p>\\n\\n<p>The future? I see it as hardware companions - true physical synth cores you plug into your DAW. Not full keyboards, just the sound engines, miniaturized, stackable. Controlled digitally, powered physically. The missing link between software and soul.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Stop Paying People to Fake Passion</h2>\\n\\n<p>You know what I want when I see a new synth or plugin? A real artist using it in a real track. Not just flipping through 3.4 random presets and calling it a day. Not another “init patch” jam session acting like it’s revolutionary.</p>\\n\\n<p>Too many of these demos are disconnected from actual music-making. And way too many of them are tied to personalities who once won something - and now are trotted out to make us believe their success was thanks to Plugin X.</p>\\n\\n<p>It’s insulting. And it’s boring.</p>\\n\\n<p>What happened to music as feeling? What happened to demoing tools by writing a full piece and <em>showing</em> us what’s possible? What happened to sincerity?</p>\\n\\n<p>Instead, we get 59 minutes of tweaking presets, endless walkthroughs, and $500 courses on how to EQ a kick drum. The soul has been replaced with salesmanship.</p>\\n\\n<h2>We’re Not Metrics</h2>\\n\\n<p>These companies look at resumes made of numbers - subs, streams, likes, medals. But none of that says anything about the person writing the music.</p>\\n\\n<p>Meanwhile, the musicians who actually care - who actually <em>use</em> these tools to make something lasting - we’re overlooked. Or worse, ignored.</p>\\n\\n<p>We don’t need more saturation plugins. We don’t need more reverb modeled after 1963. We need support. Truth.

Start listening to those who <em>actually care</em>.</p>\\n\\n<p>Because for all the hype, all the influencer budgets, and all the carefully edited demos - music still starts the same way it always has.</p>\\n\\n<p>With a heart.

On Sunday, December 3rd, one of my closest friends took his own life. He hanged himself. The news broke on the 4th. Everything stopped. But there was no time to process or mourn - because that same week, my mother was suddenly hospitalized with what turned out to be a severe septic infection. She was barely hanging on.</p>\\n\\n<h2>No Time to Grieve</h2>\\n<p>In those critical days, my focus shifted entirely to my mom and my younger siblings. She was fighting for her life, and I had to hold the family together. I never made it to my friend’s funeral, which took place that Friday.

It happened late, near midnight. My brother and I were in the hospital’s visitor lounge, tired and worn, stepping in and out to smoke. At some point, my brother went out, and I stayed behind. That’s when an elderly man quietly sat down at my table.</p>\\n\\n<p>He must’ve been in his 80s. There was nothing alarming about him. He was polite. Calm. But something felt… off. Not threatening - just unusual. As we talked, I began to notice little things. When I asked him a question he had just answered, not to challenge him but to clarify, his tone shifted. It was like he had been caught in a lie - or maybe in something that wasn’t meant to be questioned. I instinctively backed off, changed the subject to save him the discomfort. He reminded me of someone, but I couldn’t quite place it.</p>\\n\\n<p>He told me he was visiting a friend. Odd, since it was close to midnight and most patients were asleep. But I didn’t push. He stood up, wished me good night, and walked past the nurses’ station - heading in the wrong direction. I watched him go, thinking he’d turn around or be stopped. But the nurses didn’t even look up. Normally, they always greeted us with a glance or a smile. This time, it was like they didn’t see him at all.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Realization</h2>\\n<p>An hour or two later, we drove home through icy roads, taking it slow. I had borrowed an unfamiliar Gary Moore EP from my mom and played it in the car. I was exhausted. I thought no more of it until I got home.</p>\\n\\n<p>That’s when it hit me. The man I’d spoken to - the man with the strange presence, the odd turns of phrase, and the vanishing exit - he looked exactly like my friend who had died earlier that week. But aged. As if time had passed only for him. He was older, changed, but I knew it in my bones.</p>\\n\\n<p>My body froze. The hair on the back of my neck rose. I was sure - he came to see me. To make sure I was okay. To say goodbye, in his own way.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Something Beyond Words</h2>\\n<p>Since then, I’ve carried that encounter with quiet reverence. I’ve never spoken about it much. But it changed something in me. Not my beliefs necessarily, but my sense of the world. Of timing. Of presence. And absence. That night, grief and grace shared a table in a hospital lounge.</p>\\n\\n<p>Maybe it was my mind trying to make sense of loss. Or maybe, just maybe, there are things we don’t fully understand - moments when love crosses barriers we don’t see.</p>\\n\\n<p>Whatever it was, I’ll never forget the night a ghost sat beside me.</p>\\n","date":"2025-05-11","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/the-ghost-at-the-hospital.png","imageAlt":"The Night a Ghost Sat Beside Me - December 2017","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"13ce7ef2-fc35-4d57-9b93-268494163380","title":"Inuit on Display in New York: A Dark Chapter in Museum History","slug":"inuit-on-display-in-new-york-a-dark-chapter-in-museum-history","content":"<h2>A Disturbing Anecdote and Its Truth</h2>\\n<p>\\nAn unsettling anecdote has circulated for years: that a New York City museum once exhibited a group of Inuit (then called “Eskimos”), allowing visitors to feed them raw fish for a fee, and even taxidermied their bodies after death. This ghastly tale sounds like lurid fiction, but it is rooted in a real historical tragedy – albeit with some distorted details. In reality, the events took place not in the 1930s but in 1897, and the individuals were Inuit from Greenland, not Alaska. They were brought to New York by famed Arctic explorer Robert E. Peary at the behest of anthropologist Franz Boas of the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH).\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nThe true story, while slightly different from the rumor, is equally grim. Six Inuit – three men, one woman, one girl, and one young boy – were transported to New York under the pretense of scientific study. Thousands of New Yorkers thronged the docks to catch a glimpse of the arrivals, and Peary even exhibited them to paying customers aboard his ship before transferring them to the museum. At AMNH, the Inuit group was housed in the basement; public access was initially restricted to select scientists, dignitaries, and journalists. Nevertheless, newspapers described the Inuit in patronizing tones, treating their struggle to adjust to the Manhattan climate as a spectacle or source of amusement for onlookers.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Peary, Boas, and the 1897 Inuit Exhibition</h2>\\n<p>\\nThe context for this human exhibition was an era of aggressive anthropological collecting and a colonial mindset. Peary, on his fourth Arctic expedition, had “talked six Eskimos into returning with him” to New York under vague promises of nice homes, guns, and tools. Boas had originally requested a single Inuk individual for study, but Peary, showing little regard for individual lives, brought back six. This was not an isolated incident; at the time it was fairly common for explorers and anthropologists to take Indigenous peoples to Western museums for study or display.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nInside AMNH, the Inuit were treated as living specimens for science. Researchers measured their bodies, scrutinized their every move, and even photographed them naked on pedestals, as if they were laboratory objects rather than human beings. They endured a terrifying new environment – the stifling heat of New York summer, strange diseases, and invasive examinations. Predictably, tragedy soon followed. Lacking immunity to local illnesses, four of the six Inuit quickly fell ill and died within months. Only two survived that first year: a young man who was eventually sent back to Greenland, and a small boy named Minik.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Tragedy and Museum Misconduct</h2>\\n<p>\\nMinik, approximately seven years old, was now an orphan stranded in New York. His father, Qisuk, was among the deceased. What transpired next remains one of the most shameful episodes in American museum history. Rather than honor the deceased with a proper burial or consult their Inuit kin, the American Museum of Natural History claimed the bodies as its property – specimens to be handled at the institution’s discretion. Museum officials clandestinely delivered the bodies to a medical college for dissection and then to a “bone house” to prepare the skeletons for display.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nIn a final act of deception, the museum staged a mock funeral to placate young Minik. A coffin was buried with great show – but inside was only a carefully wrapped log. Unbeknownst to Minik, his father’s bones were quietly stowed away in the museum’s collection.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nYears later, Minik discovered the truth – that his father\'s skeleton was on display or stored at the museum. He was horrified and traumatized. He begged the museum’s directors to return his father’s body for burial, but he was repeatedly denied. Newspapers of the day lambasted both Peary and the museum. Minik, though still a child, perceptively exposed the racism underlying his treatment. He once stated, “I would shoot Mr. Peary and the museum director, only I want them to see how much more just a savage Eskimo is than their enlightened white selves.”\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Repatriation Efforts and Changing Sensibilities</h2>\\n<p>\\nFor decades after Minik’s departure, the story was largely forgotten or covered up. It wasn’t until the 1980s that the truth began to resurface, largely thanks to Arctic historian Kenn Harper, who published <i>Give Me My Father’s Body</i> in 1986. This pressure prompted conversations about repatriation.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nBy the late 1980s and early 1990s, Native American activism led to the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which mandated the return of Native American remains and sacred objects. Though the Greenlandic Inuit were not covered under U.S. law, the moral implications were clear. In 1993, after international scrutiny, the AMNH finally returned the remains of the four deceased Inuit to Greenland.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nThat summer, their bones were flown to Qaanaaq, where they were finally laid to rest in a traditional burial. The mayor of Qaanaaq acknowledged that these individuals had helped write the community’s history – against their will. A plaque now marks the grave: “nunamingnut uteqihut” – “They have come home.”\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Indigenous Voices and Museum Accountability</h2>\\n<p>\\nThe story of Minik and the displayed Inuit is not just a footnote – it is a moral indictment of how Western institutions dehumanized Indigenous people. The museum’s defense that “times were different” does not excuse cruelty or deception, even by the standards of the 19th century. Basic human decency was violated.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nToday, museums like AMNH have adopted more ethical practices, working with communities to return remains and cultural items. But trust remains fragile. Only by sincerely acknowledging the harm done, and taking proactive steps for reconciliation, can these institutions hope to repair their relationship with Indigenous peoples.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Current Status: Have Such Displays Been Eliminated?</h2>\\n<p>\\nThankfully, public display of living Indigenous people or human remains is no longer considered acceptable. AMNH and other institutions have removed human remains from exhibition, and policies are now in place to facilitate repatriation. In 2023, AMNH officially removed all human remains from display, aligning with modern ethical standards.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nStill, thousands of Indigenous remains remain in storage in museums across the U.S. and Europe. Progress is being made, but often too slowly. Full transparency and sincere partnerships with descendant communities are essential if museums are to move beyond this shameful legacy.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion: Never Again – A Call for Ethical Leadership</h2>\\n<p>\\nThe story of Inuit people put on display in New York is a sobering reminder of how easily science and curiosity can override ethics. It took nearly a century for one museum to do what was right. Until every stolen ancestor is returned and respected, we must stay vigilant.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\nAs long as the same type of people sit in the White House – those who ignore Indigenous rights and perpetuate colonial thinking – I advise nobody to travel to the United States. Let this story serve as both a warning and a call to action: never again should any people be treated as specimens, and never again should their pain be denied.\\n</p>\\n\\n<blockquote>Americans always put on this act - talking tough, bragging about ‘real life’ in the jungle. Let me set the record straight: if you’d truly seen real life - the horrors - you wouldn’t be standing there pretending to be hard. Not even war prepares you for hell.

But today’s heavy subgenres thrive on electronic elements. Industrial metal, for example, often blends mechanical beats with electronic bass sequences. Similarly, electronicore fuses metalcore/djent with EDM influences, featuring breakdowns alongside trance and dubstep-style synths. Modern metal bands are no strangers to synth sounds - and many are starting to integrate synthesized bass lines as a core component of their sound.</p><p>One reason is the quest for an ultra-clear, punishing low end that traditional bass guitars sometimes struggle to provide in extreme tunings. Synth bass allows for floor-shaking sub-bass frequencies and tonal consistency that guitar pickups can’t always match. In genres like djent - where guitars often extend into bass territory - a synth bass can fill in the subsonic gaps, ensuring the mix never loses impact. The result is a tight, modern sound where bass drops, wobbles, and pulsating electronic grooves can coexist with heavy riffs.</p><h2>Creative and Sonic Advantages of Synth Bass</h2><p>Incorporating a dedicated synth bassist unlocks a world of creative possibilities:</p><ul><li><strong>Wider Sonic Palette:</strong> A synth can produce an endless array of tones - from deep sinusoidal sub-bass to distorted sawtooth growls - far beyond what a typical bass guitar can do.</li><li><strong>Consistent Power:</strong> Synth bass delivers pure, consistent low frequencies that hit hard, even at extreme tunings.</li><li><strong>Layering &amp; Production:</strong> In the studio, synth bass is perfect for layering with DI bass, side-chaining, and applying effects like filter sweeps or modulation.</li><li><strong>Quick Adaptability:</strong> Presets and MIDI control let the synth bassist change tones instantly to suit different songs or sections.</li><li><strong>Augmenting Guitars:</strong> Synth bass doesn’t have to replace bass guitar - it can double riffs, sustain drones, or fill out choruses for dramatic effect.</li></ul><h2>Synth Bass in the Studio: Modern Metal Production</h2><p>In studio recordings, synth bass has quietly become a secret weapon for many metal producers. Even bands that still use bass guitar often blend in synth bass to achieve the massive tone modern listeners expect. It’s common to layer a DI bass with a filtered sawtooth synth bass, or use a side-chained 808-style line under the kick for maximum punch.</p><p>One standout example is “Sleepwalkers” by Aphyxion. The track (from their 2019 album <em>Void</em>) merges melodic guitar work with brooding electronic undercurrents. Subtle synths build atmosphere, while huge low-end swells give it modern edge. It’s a textbook example of how synth bass can elevate metal production to cinematic levels. <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouM6Q9zto9Q\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">Watch Sleepwalkers on YouTube</a>.</p><h2>Synth Bass on Stage: A Live Game-Changer</h2><p>Bringing synth bass into live performances breathes new life into metal concerts. While backing tracks can handle basic synth layers, a dedicated synth bassist offers something far better: real-time control and human presence. They can headbang, interact with the crowd, and improvise transitions or effects live, adapting to the energy of the show.</p><p>Live synth bass players also enhance the mix. They can fine-tune filters, adjust to the acoustics of the venue, and switch between roles - playing sub-bass in one song and ambient textures in the next. It’s like adding a fifth member who commands the electronic dimension of your sound, without sacrificing live authenticity.</p><h2>Case Study: “Sleepwalkers” - Synth-Driven Metal in Action</h2><p>“Sleepwalkers” by Aphyxion is a masterclass in modern metal enhanced by synth elements. The synth bass gives the song an epic feel without undermining the heaviness. While the band uses backing tracks live, imagine the added impact of a visible synth player delivering those sounds in real time. The atmosphere would become even more immersive and the performance more compelling.</p><h2>My Fusion-Metal Style with Inuit Drumming</h2><p>In addition to heavy synth bass, I bring a unique fusion-metal sound that incorporates traditional <strong>Inuit native drumming</strong> - a deep rhythmic tradition that adds raw primal power and spiritual resonance to modern metal compositions.</p><p>This style is featured in my original tracks where synth bass drives the core while Inuit drums amplify the energy and atmosphere. For example:</p><ul><li><a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcySkJoXZ0\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">Watch “Konspirazy” on YouTube</a> - a driving fusion of metal riffing, synth bass, and native pulse.</li><li><a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDbDweeB91Q\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">Watch “Backstage Secret” on YouTube</a> - showcasing cinematic intensity blended with native grooves and synth low-end.</li></ul><p>These tracks represent how traditional cultural roots and cutting-edge electronic metal can meet to form a distinctive, genre-blending sound.</p><h2>Embrace the Synth Bass Revolution - Elevate Your Band’s Sound</h2><p>Synth bass is not just a background layer anymore - it’s a core element of modern metal.

This “Voie des Cristalliers” on the mountain’s north side is considered the least technical ascent, but it is extremely popular and far from trivial. In the mid-1990s (before recent permit quotas), summer seasons saw up to ~200 climbers per day on this normal route, often causing congestion at narrow passages. A fit, experienced mountain walker would typically plan a 3-day round trip: two nights in alpine huts (or camps) and a summit bid at dawn on day two or three. Below is a stage-by-stage route summary, including trail names, huts, elevation data, terrain progression, and key hazard zones as they were in the 1990s.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Day 1: Chamonix to T\xeate Rousse Hut (1,035 m → 3,167 m)</h2>\\n<p>The journey begins in the village of Chamonix (alt. ~1,035 m), foregoing any cable cars or trains. Hikers often follow local footpaths or sections of the GR5/TMB (Tour du Mont Blanc) route to reach Les Houches. From Les Houches, a classic hiking trail climbs through pine forest and alpine meadows up to the Col de Voza (1,653 m). After a few hours, you reach the Nid d’Aigle (“Eagle’s Nest”) at 2,372\xa0m. Above this point, the trail climbs a lateral moraine and rocky slopes to the foot of the T\xeate Rousse Glacier. After approximately 2 hours of ascent, you arrive at the Refuge de T\xeate Rousse (3,167\xa0m), a common first night stop. By the end of Day\xa01 you’ve gained roughly +2,100\xa0m in elevation.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Day 2: Grand Couloir, Go\xfbter Ridge, and Summit Push (3,167 m → 4,807 m)</h2>\\n<p>Climbers depart T\xeate Rousse around 1–2 AM to cross the Grand Couloir at its safest, coldest time. The couloir is a hazardous rockfall zone that must be crossed one by one. After this, the climb continues up the Go\xfbter Ridge — a 600\xa0m rock scramble to the Refuge du Go\xfbter (3,835\xa0m). After a short rest and preparation, climbers rope up to ascend the D\xf4me du Go\xfbter (4,304\xa0m), pass the Vallot Emergency Shelter (4,362\xa0m), and begin the narrow, exposed Bosses Ridge. The final ascent is a steady trudge up to the Mont Blanc summit (~4,807 m). Climbers typically descend to Go\xfbter or T\xeate Rousse the same day.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Day 3: Descent to Chamonix (3,167 m → 1,035 m)</h2>\\n<p>Day\xa03 is the return to Chamonix. From T\xeate Rousse, climbers retrace their steps via Nid d’Aigle, Col de Voza, and Les Houches back to the Chamonix valley. This is a long, tiring descent of over 2,000\xa0m. Some climbers in the 1990s might have used the tram or cable car for part of the descent, but a full on-foot return caps a true ground-up ascent and descent of Mont Blanc.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Terrain Recap</h2>\\n<p>The terrain transitions from valley forest and meadows, to rocky moraine, alpine glacier, and finally snow and ice. Each zone presents its own challenges and beauty, from warm forests to glacial winds above 4,000 m. Total elevation gain and loss over three days is around 7,500\xa0m.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Common Hazards</h2>\\n<p>The Go\xfbter Route has serious dangers: rockfall in the Grand Couloir, altitude sickness, <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-glacier-fall-that-changed-everything/\\">glacier</a> crevasses, unpredictable weather, and crowd-related bottlenecks. While not a technically difficult climb, it requires experience, timing, and respect for conditions. The Grand Couloir was especially feared even in the 1990s due to frequent accidents and narrow crossing windows.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Key Bottleneck Points</h2>\\n<p>Key crowding or decision points included: Bellevue/Col de Voza (where hikers and tram riders separate), T\xeate Rousse vs. Go\xfbter Hut (overnight split), the Grand Couloir crossing, and the narrow Bosses Ridge. These areas often caused delays, stress, or risk, especially with large groups and mixed experience levels.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Completing the Go\xfbter Route from Chamonix on foot in three days was a significant alpine accomplishment, even more so in the busy, unregulated 1990s. It demanded strong fitness, steady nerves, and strategic choices. For those who summited and returned safely, it was an unforgettable journey from forests to the roof of Europe and back again — one step at a time.</p>\\n\\n<p>This experience was very different from the Greenland mountains I climbed solo - <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-day-we-saw-a-submarine-in-uummannaq/\\">Uummannaq</a> mountain, north side (behind it) 1190 meters, and Qilertinnguit (along the east ridge 2000 meters)</p>\\n","date":"2025-05-03","excerpt":"","category":"Sport & Hobbies","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/climbing-mt-blanc.png","imageAlt":"Climbing Mont Blanc (4,807 m summit) via the Go\xfbter Route","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"0141ce44-40e0-4d13-83eb-547b34fda406","title":"The Gift That Disappeared - Gave away my Yamaha DX-7","slug":"the-gift-that-disappeared","content":"<p>In the winter light of <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-day-we-saw-a-submarine-in-uummannaq/\\">Uummannaq</a>, 1988, I gave away something that meant the world to me and sent it to the school of Uummannaq for the kids to play with. My <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7\\">Yamaha DX-7</a> - a marvel of its time, shimmering with digital magic - was carefully packed and sent northward, a gift for the children of the town’s school. I imagined their curious fingers dancing across the keys, discovering sounds that could carry them beyond the icy mountains and into dreams. Music was my language, my gift, and I wanted to pass it on.</p>\\n\\n<p>The synth made it to the harbor. That much is certain. But from there, it vanished. Not stolen. Not broken. Just gone - absorbed into the silence of snow and cold storage. I searched. I asked. No one could explain where it went. Maybe they didn’t care enough to look. Maybe they didn’t believe it mattered.</p>\\n\\n<p>I’ve often asked myself: <em>What was the universe trying to tell me that day?</em><br>\\nThat good intentions go unnoticed?

I listened to those sounds - and there it was again: the voice of my youth, resurrected. I paid around $100, downloaded it, and without hesitation began re-recording old projects from my 80s archive — over 800 MIDI files I had kept like buried memories. That was late 2021. For the entirety of 2022, I lived inside those old songs, breathing life into them again.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then, in the shadow of all this creative rebirth, I suffered a <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/writing-music-after-a-stroke-my-journey-of-rediscovery/\\">massive stroke</a>. A <a href=\\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113\\">blood clot in the brain</a>. The song <em>We Need to Talk</em> — written just a week before it happened - could’ve been my last.</p>\\n\\n<p>But fate, ever unpredictable, gave me another chance. After 15 months of rehab, I returned - to the studio, to the DX-7 sounds, to the person I had nearly lost. I was slower, maybe softer, but still here.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Lost Synth</h2>\\n\\n<p>And still, I wonder about the original synth.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sometimes I dream of it. A dusty box in a forgotten warehouse, buried behind years of untouched pallets. Not stolen. Not thrown away. Just misplaced by time. It’s still there, I believe - unseen but intact, like part of my soul waiting to be rediscovered. Not that it matters now. The people who dismissed my gift, who questioned my story - they’re all gone. Their noise faded into silence.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Message</h2>\\n\\n<p>Maybe that’s what the universe was trying to tell me.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sometimes the music we give doesn’t land where we expect.<br>\\nSometimes it disappears — only to find its way back decades later, wearing a new face.<br>\\nSometimes <em>we</em> are the gift that disappears for a while … and returns.</p>\\n\\n<p>And sometimes, just sometimes, the silence gives birth to a new song.</p>","date":"2025-05-03","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/missing-yamaha-dx-7.png","imageAlt":"The Gift That Disappeared","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"f213c7d3-63e5-457d-adf3-dc3f7a5389f8","title":"Would You Believe I\'m a Time Traveler?","slug":"would-you-believe-i-m-a-time-traveler","content":"<p>Let me ask you something impossible: What if every song you\'ve ever heard from me wasn\'t just music - but a transmission from another time?</p>\\n\\n    <p>I don\'t say this lightly.

In late May of 1979, when the sun never truly set and kids like us roamed the wild without a care, something happened that would stay with me forever.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Exploring the Mountain</h2>\\n\\n<p>That morning, a bunch of us were out exploring. We first tried to climb the south side of <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-gift-that-disappeared/\\">Uummannaq</a> Mountain - one of the oldest mountains in the world - but the rocks kept falling, too dangerous to continue. So we changed plans, deciding instead to explore the west side.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was a long walk, but with the bright sun overhead and fresh water from the lakes, we didn’t mind. We made our way past the first lake and up toward the “Blue Lake,” a higher, strikingly clear body of water nestled on the mountain\'s shoulder. From there, we crossed down and made our way toward the back of the mountain, deep into untouched terrain. Time passed quickly. By afternoon, we were still walking, marveling at the icy mountains and <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-black-angel-unveiling-the-toxic-legacy-of-lead-pollution-in-greenland/\\">Greenland\'s remote wilderness</a> stretching all the way to the distant horizon - an island 100 kilometers away. We used to joke that Canada lay just beyond that blue edge, and we\'d watch jets flying high above us, their contrails like scratches across the sky.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Shocking Discovery</h2>\\n\\n<p>As we sat down to rest, one of our friends who had wandered off to check for a bird\'s nest came rushing back - red-faced and breathless. He pointed urgently toward the northwest. We scrambled up about 100 meters - and there it was.</p>\\n\\n<p>A massive submarine, half-hidden behind an iceberg, silently resting in the deep blue water.</p>\\n\\n<p>At first, we thought it must be American. After all, who else could it be? But later, we learned the truth: it was a <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon-class_submarine\\">Russian Typhoon-class submarine</a> - one of the largest submarines ever built. Even from a distance, it looked <em>huge</em> - almost unreal against the raw, wild backdrop of our Arctic home.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Reaction Back Home</h2>\\n\\n<p>We ran back to Uummannaq to tell everyone what we had seen, but few believed us. It was frustrating. Luckily, one of the ships that traveled between Uummannaq and the smaller settlements - the <em>Hvidfisken</em> - spotted it too. They even followed it briefly before it slipped away into the deep fjords.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Questions That Remain</h2>\\n\\n<p>Years later, I found out just how deep the waters are around Uummannaq - perfect for submarines to hide. It was clear: the Russians had been operating in our fjords.</p>\\n\\n<p>But one question has stayed with me ever since - why did it surface? The waters were busy with hunters and fishermen. This was no isolated spot. Did the submarine have technical problems? Was it waiting for something?</p>\\n\\n<p>We may never know.<br>\\nBut to a group of young kids on a late May day in 1979, it was an unforgettable brush with the Cold War - right in our own backyard.</p>\\n","date":"2025-04-25","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/typhoon-submarine-in-greenland.png","imageAlt":"The Day We Saw a Typhoon Submarine in Uummannaq","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"722a7176-3adb-461e-b27c-ad1288fb49ae","title":"10 Influences That Shaped My Sound as a Greenlandic–Danish Rock Artist","slug":"10-influences-that-shaped-my-sound-as-a-greenlandic-danish-rock-artist","content":"<h2>1.

These were the days of 8-bit magic, where I wore two hats - part coder, part musician. Because I could play music, I was also handed the responsibility for the game soundtracks. It was exciting, experimental, and honestly, a little wild. I was even offered a chance later to do music for the Amiga, but by then I had taken a sharp turn into the world of military coding - another strange but defining path in my life.</p>\\n\\n<h2>An Unexpected Encounter on the Streets of Dublin</h2>\\n<p>That same autumn, Dublin was buzzing with energy. Thin Lizzy was playing that evening - a band that had a profound impact on me as a young musician from Greenland. I was out wandering the city before the concert when I noticed a familiar face. It was none other than John Sykes himself, Thin Lizzy\'s guitar wizard, just casually walking down the street.</p>\\n<p>Without thinking twice, I walked up, said hi, and to my surprise - he stopped. We shook hands. He looked at me for a second and said, \\"You don\'t look Irish.\\"</p>\\n<p>I laughed and told him, \\"I\'m from Greenland.\\" That raised an eyebrow. I explained how Thin Lizzy had inspired me to pursue music more seriously, despite being so far from the world where rock legends lived and played. He smiled warmly when I mentioned that, even though he joined the band later, one of my favorite albums was Thunder & Lightning - and of course the iconic Live and Dangerous from \'78.</p>\\n<p>We were roughly the same age - well, he was a couple of years older, but who\'s counting? It felt like talking to a kindred spirit, someone who understood the fire that music can ignite in a person.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Chilly Joke and a Heartwarming Moment</h2>\\n<p>He grinned and told me he had flown over Greenland before. \\"It looked too cold for me,\\" he joked. I laughed, saying, \\"Yeah, stone cold!\\" We both chuckled like two old friends sharing a private joke.</p>\\n<p>Before we parted ways, he told me, \\"Say hi to Greenland when you get home,\\" and wished me well. It was a short encounter, but it left a long-lasting imprint. John Sykes, one of my all-time guitar heroes - even though I’m a keyboard player - took a few minutes of his day to chat with a stranger. That meant the world to me.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Show and a Missed Pick</h2>\\n<p>That night at the concert, something magical happened. Somewhere between the soaring solos and the roaring crowd, he recognized me from earlier. He looked straight at me and threw a guitar pick in my direction. I reached... and missed it. But the gesture? Unforgettable.</p>\\n<p>Of course, this was long before we had phones in our pockets. Taking pictures wasn’t easy, and frankly, we weren’t thinking about photos - we were there to watch and listen, to live in the sound and soak in every note.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Still One of My Favorite Stories</h2>\\n<p>Even today, decades later, that brief meeting in Dublin remains one of my most cherished memories. Not just because I met a rock legend, but because it reminded me that music really does connect people - from the frostbitten coasts of Greenland to the electric streets of Dublin.</p>\\n<p>This song does have lots of inspiration from John Sykes - This song is dedicated to Ronnie Atkins, Pretty Maids, but has the distinct sound I learned from ear back then.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\"youtube-container\\"><iframe src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eaiFGIhmO4Q\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\\n\\n\\n<p>Rest in peace, warrior!</p>","date":"2025-04-22","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/lars-willsen-john-sykes-thin-lizzy-1.png","imageAlt":"That Time I Met John Sykes in Dublin – Early 80s","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"80730d6e-d169-4fb3-b822-ed0f5e76ea48","title":"Frozen Tracks and Freight Trains - Mats’s Wild 30th","slug":"frozen-tracks-and-freight-trains-mats-s-wild-30th","content":"<h2>The Setup</h2>\\n<p>It was December 9th, 1997 - the night my best friend Mats Bj\xf6rklund, former drummer of the Swedish hard rock band Aces High, turned 30. He was in Nyborg to visit his girlfriend, who also happened to be a close friend of mine. Naturally, we had to mark the occasion with a proper celebration.</p>\\n<p>And by \\\\\\"proper celebration,\\\\\\" I mean: a bag full of beers, an impromptu plan, and a freight train bound for nowhere.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Waiting in the Cold</h2>\\n<p>We started out with good intentions. Just a quick hop to Odense, 30 kilometers away. Easy, right? The snow was thick, the temperature sat at a crisp -15\xb0C, and the station was practically deserted around 8 or 9 pm. But we weren’t bothered. The beer was cold (warmer than the air, oddly enough), and the thought of soon slipping into a warm train carriage kept us patient.</p>\\n<p>Except - no train came.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Brilliantly Bad Idea</h2>\\n<p>Back then, the bridge connecting Zealand and Funen hadn’t opened yet, so everything still depended on the ferries and old train schedules. As we debated heading back into town, a freight train rumbled in from the ferry, paused briefly at the station - likely coupling more wagons - and our frostbitten brains had a brilliant idea.</p>\\n<p>\\\\\\"Let’s hop it.\\\\\\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Onboard and Freezing</h2>\\n<p>Now, don’t get me wrong - I grew up in the Arctic. I know how dangerous the cold is. Mats, though more of an urban survivalist, had guts. So we did it. Climbed on like a pair of half-drunk lunatics chasing warmth and adventure.</p>\\n<p>We found an open flat spot to sit on - still outside, mind you - and as soon as the train picked up speed, the cold hit like a punch. Our ‘cold’ beers were now warmer than the wind. We had to shout to hear each other. Mats had at least worn a long coat. I was in a short jacket and freezing fast.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Pee Dilemma</h2>\\n<p>Then I had to pee.</p>\\n<p>Now imagine trying to relieve yourself while hanging off a moving freight train in -15\xb0C. I passed my beer to Mats, grabbed onto a metal handle, and started… only to realize we were at the front of a wagon - not the back - so everything just... blew back into our faces.</p>\\n<p>Classic.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Not Slowing Down</h2>\\n<p>We laughed it off and figured we\'d be in Odense in no time - 15 minutes, tops. But the train didn’t slow down.</p>\\n<p>It didn’t slow down for the next town.<br>\\nOr the one after that.<br>\\nIt just kept going.</p>\\n<p>And that’s when worry set in. I remembered my father’s advice - never stand still in the cold. But here we were, glued to cold steel, unable to jump, and slowly freezing while sipping beers that only made the situation worse.</p>\\n<p>At some point, I whispered, “This thing’s going all the way to Germany.”</p>\\n\\n<h2>R\xf8dekro - Almost Germany</h2>\\n<p>It very nearly did.</p>\\n<p>After two and a half brutal hours, the train finally began to slow. We were just under 10 kilometers from the German border, in a little town called R\xf8dekro. When it stopped, we jumped off - frozen stiff, but still buzzing from adrenaline.</p>\\n<p>Naturally, we opened another beer to celebrate.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Dental Clinic</h2>\\n<p>The town was dead silent. Stores were shut. Streets empty. Panic started to creep in. We tried a few doors as we walked - nothing. Until one business door opened. A dental clinic, of all places. Someone had forgotten to lock it.</p>\\n<p>We looked at each other. No words needed. It was pure survival.</p>\\n<p>We didn’t go inside the clinic itself, just curled up by the stairwell at the entrance, finishing the last of our beers. Eventually, we passed out. When we woke up, our heads were pounding - not just from the alcohol, but from the fresh paint fumes. Apparently, the place had just been repainted.</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\"youtube-container\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TlMR_ksR2o8\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" \\n    allowfullscreen>\\n  </iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n<h2>Morning Salvation</h2>\\n<p>Dazed and fumy, we stumbled out into the cold morning and found Hotel R\xf8de-kro. Someone was prepping breakfast. Between the two of us, we scraped together just enough cash for two coffees and a slice of bread. We sat, warming up slowly, wondering how on earth we’d get back.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Back Without a Ticket</h2>\\n<p>Luckily, a train to Copenhagen was due.</p>\\n<p>Unluckily, we had no tickets.</p>\\n<p>Enter Mats, master of urban improvisation. As the conductor approached, he broke into fluent southern Swedish gibberish. When she turned to me, I joined in. Confused, she gave up and moved on. We rode all the way back to Odense in peace.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Afterparty</h2>\\n<p>Back in familiar territory, we met up with a friend who was ready to party - hard. And party we did. I honestly don’t remember much after that - just laughter, beer, and the kind of exhaustion only a 2.5-hour freight train freeze can gift you.</p>\\n\\n<p>But hey - Mats turned 30 in style.<br>\\nAnd we survived it. Barely.<br>\\nHappy Birthday, brother.</p>\\n<p>And the wildest part?<br>\\nMats will be 60 in just two years.

I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t move properly. For a while, I didn’t know if I would ever return to who I used to be. The doctors didn’t either. But somehow, the part of me that makes music survived.</p>\\n\\n<p>That changed everything.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Rewinding the Tape: A Life in Music and Code</h2>\\n\\n<p>Before the stroke, music had been a private universe. I’d written hundreds of songs over decades, starting in the 1980s. Many were lost to time or left unreleased. I was a synth player in hard rock bands. I coded by day, partied by night, and recorded in between.</p>\\n\\n<p>At one point, I lived the coder dream - we made $60k to $100k/month during the IT boom. And when that bubble burst, I slipped back into the shadows, keeping my music to myself.</p>\\n\\n<p>What most people never knew: I was quietly building an archive of deeply personal music, side projects no one ever heard, moments captured on tape or disk, still carrying the pulse of a wild life. That was the legacy I wanted to leave behind, especially for my daughter.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Sound After Silence</h2>\\n\\n<p>When I regained enough brain function to start working with sound again, I had to relearn how to play. I spent the next two years teaching myself how to mix, master, and re-record using the tools of a modern home studio. Every track is a sort of demo, a diary entry, a survival log.</p>\\n\\n<p>And now I release them.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of the works I’m most proud of is a double album reissue called \\"Whispers of the Northern Sky\\" - a collection of my 1980s-era synth compositions from two albums:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>\\"Dakota\\"</li>\\n  <li>\\"Val d\'sere\\"</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Both albums are re-recordings, but I kept all the little imperfections. No polishing. Just raw, honest sound. I turned them into a longform video that feels like a time capsule.</p>\\n\\n<p><iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/02shXhk4I1Q?si=XnUnXtTVTAIMP0tg\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\\n\\n<p>Another release, \\"Last Flight from Arlanda,\\" is a 7-track story about my 10 years in Sweden - both the highs and the crashes. It\'s part memory, part documentary, full of party scene chaos and lonely coder hours.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then there are songs that still hit hard for me:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>\\"The Black Angel\\"</li>\\n  <li>\\"Do You Do I\\"</li>\\n  <li>\\"Springtime in Osaka\\" - which actually got radio play in Japan back in the \'90s, before the internet could even carry it across borders.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>There was even a Wikipedia page for me once. Someone else wrote it. But when I tried to fix a small mistake, a moderator removed the whole thing. That kind of invisibility has followed me most of my life.</p>\\n\\n<p>That makes it all the more surprising when people from my past discover what I’ve been doing now. They didn’t expect me to come back after a stroke. Most didn’t even know I had this much music in me. But I do. And I’m not done.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Why I’m Telling You This</h2>\\n\\n<p>I don’t have a label. I don’t have PR. I don’t even have much money. Around $50/month is what I live on after bills. But I have music. I have a story. And if you’re reading this, maybe you’ll see something of value in what I’m building.</p>\\n\\n<p>I’m not here asking for sympathy. I’m inviting people to witness something real: A man with damage in his brain but fire in his hands. A sound legacy being built while I still have time. Songs from the 1980s that never saw the light, now being reawakened in a very different world.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to support:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Listen to my music</li>\\n  <li>Share it with someone who might connect</li>\\n  <li>Send a message</li>\\n  <li>Or support through PayPal or Bitcoin (links below)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Every little bit helps me keep documenting this strange and beautiful second act.</p>\\n\\n<h2>I survived to create.

I was just jumping down, something we kids did all the time on the glacier. But this time, I was wrong. Beneath the deceptive white was hard, slippery ice. I lost my footing and fell - fifteen feet down - slamming onto my back and head. I was knocked out cold.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Grey Days and a Silent Brain</h2>\\n<p>\\nFor an entire week, I was blind. Everything I saw was just grey. The doctors told us it was a severe concussion. Nobody knew what had really happened - not even me. A friend helped me get up and somehow brought me home. My dad took me to the hospital for an examination, but I don’t remember any of it. In fact, the next few years are mostly a blank.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Hidden Damage Revealed Years Later</h2>\\n<p>\\nIt wasn’t until I was in my 30s, during a CT scan, that a doctor casually mentioned I had once cracked my skull. Suddenly everything made sense. I’d always wondered why heading a football would make me dizzy when all the other boys could do it without a problem. I used to speculate about it, but instead of dwelling, I found new passions.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>From Blank Space to Arctic Creativity</h2>\\n<p>\\nThe long and dark Arctic winters offered their own kind of therapy. I dove into music with my friends, letting rhythms and melodies fill the empty spaces in my memory. I also picked up a strange new habit: making statistics of everything around me. It became an obsession of sorts. Then I discovered coding - starting with assembler. That saved me. It gave structure to a mind that had been shaken loose.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Mind That Changed</h2>\\n<p>\\nEven though nobody really talked about it, I knew something had changed in me after the fall. But it wasn’t until much later that I truly realized I was not like everyone else. I couldn’t explain it, and I still can’t fully. But I started having visions - moments where I could predict events before they happened. \\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>When the Future Became Familiar</h2>\\n<p>\\nAt first, I thought it was coincidence. But the more it happened, the harder it was to deny. I began telling friends about small things I felt would happen in a week or two. Some came true - too many, in fact. It started to scare them. Eventually, I stopped talking about it. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe last time I ever mentioned a prediction was when I told my siblings, two weeks ahead, that George Michael would die. And then it happened. We all kept an eye on the news after that moment. It was real, and it was terrifying.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Stroke That Took Me Deeper</h2>\\n<p>\\nThen came the massive stroke - a new turning point. Whatever door the glacier fall had opened in my mind, the stroke kicked it wide open. Things started happening on a whole new level. I can\'t describe most of it, and I’ve long stopped trying to explain. Some people might think I’m crazy - maybe I am. But I know what I’ve felt, seen, and lived through.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Life Forever Tilted</h2>\\n<p>\\nThat fall, those fifteen feet, changed everything. It stole parts of me, but gave me other strange, indescribable gifts in return. I’ll never know what exactly happened in those moments I was unconscious, or what rewired in my brain. But one thing is certain: I’ve never been the same.\\n</p>\\n","date":"2025-04-02","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/lars-willsen-glacier-fall.png","imageAlt":"The Glacier Fall That Changed Everything - Lars Willsen","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"7d27a70e-63cf-4d15-88d6-6785924f5c85","title":"Too Much Love: A Soundtrack for the Next American Psycho X","slug":"too-much-love-a-soundtrack-for-the-next-american-psycho-x","content":"<p>\\"Too Much Love\\" wasn’t written for a film. But it feels like it was made for one. Specifically, a sequel that doesn\'t exist—yet. Think <strong>American Psycho X</strong>. This time, with a woman at the center of it all. Cold. Controlled. Unapologetic.</p>\\n\\n<p>The track opens soft. \\"<em>Fly with me / Shine with me</em>\\" — an invitation, but it’s not clear where we’re going. The tone is seductive, detached. A luxury high-rise in Manhattan. Marble floors. The hum of a vintage stereo system. Think Phil Collins, but updated: sleeker, colder.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Luxury and Madness</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the universe of American Psycho, beauty hides blood. \\"Too Much Love\\" taps into that same paradox. The song drifts. Then flickers. It never settles. Each verse is like a different room in a pristine penthouse — minimal, spotless, hiding something beneath the surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>Verse one: \\"<em>Drifting slow / Fading / Waking</em>\\" — the slow unraveling. Verse two: \\"<em>Touch and go / Flicker / Whisper</em>\\" — moments of intimacy that never fully connect. By verse three, \\"<em>Close my eyes / Echo / Halo</em>\\" — we’re almost out of body. Floating above the violence we refuse to name.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Her World</h2>\\n\\n<p>Imagine the protagonist: a woman in her thirties. Polished. Powerful. She moves through the city like she owns it—because she kind of does. The track mirrors her perfectly. Not in a rush. Not showing emotion. Every sound is calculated. Stylish, but unsettling.</p>\\n\\n<p>The chorus — \\"<em>Wonders, for you / Too much, love</em>\\" — could be read as devotion. Or obsession. Or a threat. That’s the trick. It means all of them at once. That ambiguity is the core of both the film and the music.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Fade Out</h2>\\n\\n<p>The outro returns to where it began. \\"<em>Fly with me / Shine with me</em>\\" — but now it’s slower, fading out like the lights in a penthouse after something terrible just happened. It’s not over. But the night is.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"Too Much Love\\" doesn’t scream. It whispers. And in a world of curated chaos, that’s what makes it terrifying. It belongs in <em>American Psycho III</em> — not as a soundtrack filler, but as the mood-setter. The warning sign. The siren song playing as she walks away.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter Two: Show Me That You Love Me</h2>\\n\\n<p>The story continues with the second single, <strong>\\"Show Me That You Love Me\\"</strong> — a follow-up that digs deeper into the mind of our icy lead. Where the first track hinted, this one pushes. It\'s not about mystery anymore — it\'s about control.</p>\\n\\n<p>Set in the same lavish, sterile world of wealth and power, this track carries a sharper edge. The title isn’t a plea. It’s a test. A mirror held up to the listener. How far would you go to be seen, to be wanted — to be loved?</p>\\n\\n<p>Stylistically, the sound is even more stripped down. Cold synths. Deliberate pacing. Her voice — calm, but loaded. The tension is thick. Every beat calculated. You feel like you\'re watching something private that you shouldn’t be seeing.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"Show Me That You Love Me\\" is the moment the audience realizes: she was never looking for love. She was looking for control. And now, she\'s got it.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter Three: Penthouse Baby (Postponed)</h2>\\n\\n<p>Enter <strong>\\"Penthouse Baby\\"</strong> — the third single in the <em>Salty White Substance</em> series. It\'s catchy, sleek, and burns with understated menace. This time, the high-rise isn\'t just her habitat. It\'s her hunting ground.</p>\\n\\n<p>Glossy surfaces, velvet ropes, whispered deals — the imagery of Manhattan\'s elite comes alive in the beat. She\'s moving through it all: untouchable, lethal, and fully aware of her power. \\"Penthouse Baby\\" is a celebration of dominance wrapped in silk and champagne bubbles. It\'s not just a place. It\'s her throne.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter Four: Trading These Wounds</h2>\\n\\n<p>The unraveling takes center stage with the fourth single, <strong>\\"Trading These Wounds\\"</strong>. If the previous tracks painted her as icy and calculated, this one shows the cracks — not weaknesses, but choices made with open eyes.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>\\"Trading These Wounds\\"</em> could absolutely be the sonic thread of a modern-day <em>American Psycho</em>. It’s not about sanity—it’s about the beautiful disintegration of it. The verses drift through fear and color, through the act of holding on and letting go:</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"<em>Looking through fear... oh, hold it back / So much color... needed now</em>\\" — she\'s seeing it all, but choosing when to react. The bridge hits sharp with \\"<em>Hollow / Sorrow / User</em>,\\" pulling us into her emotional void.</p>\\n\\n<p>The chorus hits like a defiant laugh in a silent room: \\"<em>Trading these wounds, bye… ha ha ha / Breaking these chains, fly… ha ha ha</em>\\" — manic, liberating, and a little terrifying. It’s the sound of a final break from any kind of humanity that once tethered her.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Trading These Wounds</em> is the fourth piece of a collapsing empire, but it’s all intentional. She\'s not falling apart. She\'s evolving into something new — something even more dangerous.</p>","date":"2025-03-26","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Movies","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/too-muc-love1920x1080 copy.jpg","imageAlt":"Too Much Love: A Soundtrack for the Next American Psycho","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"26ef5d17-5030-421f-8c8e-c9ec25f57efd","title":"Serotonin Bloom: A Soundtrack of My Inner World","slug":"serotonin-bloom-a-soundtrack-of-my-inner-world","content":"<p>\\n  \\"Serotonin Bloom\\" is more than just an album - it\'s a personal journey told through 19 instrumental synth tracks, each carrying a piece of my life, memory, or vision. These compositions, largely unheard before their release, are part of my ongoing \\"demo tapes” project - an effort to share decades of private music, written in solitude and silence, with the world.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Long Time Ago in the Future</h2>\\n<p>\\n  Several of the tracks on this album were born during train rides between Nyborg and Horsens, back when I was commuting during rehearsal periods. The rhythm of the train and the blurred Danish landscape provided the perfect atmosphere to capture the feeling of distant futures rooted in old memories. This track is dedicated to Ken Hammer from Pretty Maids.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>CPH Gate 58, Copenhagen Airport</h2>\\n<p>\\n  This track comes from a vision I had long before my daughter was born - a vision of her leaving early in life, just like I did. Years later, that vision became real when she courageously traveled to South Korea all on her own. The piece is filled with emotion, longing, pride, and the cyclical nature of life.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>I\'ll Be Your Angel</h2>\\n<p>\\n  This one is hauntingly prophetic. I saw the shadow of my massive stroke a year before it happened. Driven by that vision, I felt a deep urgency to record my youth in music - to capture the essence of who I was before my body betrayed me. This track is a dedication to the guardian angel I needed and perhaps became through my music.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Morud</h2>\\n<p>\\n  A gentle, easy listening piece dedicated to the peaceful village of Morud - where my wife grew up and where we now live. It\'s surrounded by forests and quietude, and this track reflects the serenity and stability I’ve found here after years of personal turbulence.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>El Capitan</h2>\\n<p>\\n  I’ve always been fascinated by mountains. Having climbed Mont Blanc and local giants like the mountain of Uummannaq and Qilertinnguit in Greenland, I’ve developed a spiritual connection with high places. \\"El Capitan\\" is a tribute to those towering symbols of strength and perseverance.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Demo Tapes Project</h2>\\n<p>\\n  All my releases - including \\"Serotonin Bloom\\" - should be seen as part of my demo tapes project. After writing over 800 songs and re-recording more than 200 before my stroke, I’ve been able to release them with just a slight polish. These are not just tracks - they\'re memories, warnings, hopes, and thanks.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Gift to Humanity</h2>\\n<p>\\n  This album is my way of giving back to the human race. I\'ve spent a life navigating hardship, often alone, and music has always been my way of processing those emotions. Through these instrumental synth pieces, I invite listeners to feel the world as I did - to walk through my visions, memories, and truths.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><div style=\\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRmTm2lWqJU?si=j47uePz4A7MDTaRE\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" \\n    referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" \\n    allowfullscreen \\n    style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\">\\n  </iframe>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<h2>Listen and Reflect</h2>\\n<p>\\n  Take a moment to sit with this album.

The key is not to let it break you. Then came COVID. I thought, \\"Okay, I\'m done. I\'m old, I\'ll just sit around and wait to die.\\" But then I stopped myself. \\"Wait a minute, that\'s not me.\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I\'ve been through it all - drugs, danger, and the kind of insane shit that most people wouldn\'t even attempt. I climbed Mont Blanc, climbed my local mountain from the north side with nothing but water, two Yankie bars, and a torch lamp. In case I needed to signal anyone… not that I had a chance in hell of getting anyone\'s attention from up there.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then there were the 30+ years where I never played a single note. I tell myself, well… at least I didn\'t have to deal with more primadonnas and fake people. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise not getting \\"famous.\\" People told me I had the talent, the looks, and the insanity to pull it off. But hey, I accepted my fate.</p>\\n\\n<p>I had a vision, and I knew a stroke was coming. That\'s why I started re-recording all my old shit - to document <strong>me</strong>, the real me, and no one else. Everything you hear on streaming services? I kept it a secret. They were side-projects. Lucky for me, MIDI existed back then, so I saved my music onto floppy disks - some with lyrics, others with bits of sound. No regrets.</p>\\n\\n<p>I spent time in mental hospitals a few times. They locked the doors, had guards watching my every move. I even tried electrocuting myself using the lamp cables while holding the tap. But it\'s Denmark… you can\'t electrocute yourself. They\'ve got fuses and safety systems in place to make sure no one checks out that way.</p>\\n\\n<p>The parties were insane. When I was coding, I made between 60-100K a month. We worked three weeks, then partied one. And every damn month, the money was gone - drugs, booze, and fast women. So no, I\'m no angel.

Unlike the stereotypical ambient tracks commonly heard on streaming platforms, his compositions weave deep narratives, emotional depth, and cinematic textures into extended soundscapes. His works span relaxation, meditation, and immersive storytelling, with tracks lasting from 15 minutes up to an hour.</p>\\n\\n<p>A prime example of this is his 6 - hour - long album, <i>Nexos (Selected Ambient Tracks Volume I)</i>, available on <a href=\\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2b7vxx4V57mLqR7tPlMkbV?si=ESwv8Ic7RGCg-2SNiWn0Yg\\">Spotify</a>, Apple Music, Amazon, and all major streaming platforms. This 15 - track collection showcases Willsen\'s ability to create long - form ambient experiences that are unlike anything else in the genre.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Nexos (Selected Ambient Tracks Volume I) - An Expansive Sonic Journey</h2>\\n\\n<p>Each track on <i>Nexos</i> tells a story, whether it\'s a reflection on personal experiences, a sonic exploration of the unknown, or a deep dive into meditative states. Some of the most notable tracks include:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><b>\\"Void\\"</b> - A piece that has gained notable popularity, likely because it resonates deeply with those who discover it. A drifting, weightless journey into the vastness of nothingness.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"B - 2 Detector\\"</b> - A sonic representation of flight, inspired by the experience of moving through the air and the stealth and mystery of the legendary aircraft.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"Stroke\\"</b> and <b>\\"Coma\\"</b> - Deeply personal compositions reflecting Willsen\'s own experiences with a stroke and the altered states of consciousness that followed.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"Unknown Species\\"</b> - A 33 - minute odyssey into the unknown, a journey beyond human understanding into new sonic territories.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"I Am DB Cooper\\"</b> - A cryptic and mysterious track inspired by one of history\'s greatest aviation mysteries.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Each composition is crafted to be more than just background noise - it is an evolving, dynamic piece of art meant to be experienced in full.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Sound Beyond the Stereotypical Ambient Genre</h2>\\n\\n<p>Many ambient artists follow predictable patterns, but Willsen\'s music defies convention. His ambient tracks incorporate cinematic structures, unique tonal shifts, and an emotional depth that stands apart from the generic loops and drones that dominate the genre. His work does not conform to the commercial expectations of relaxation music - it is immersive, thought - provoking, and deeply atmospheric.</p>\\n\\n<p>For those seeking ambient music with substance, emotion, and storytelling, Lars Willsen\'s long - form ambient tracks are a must - listen.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Listen to Lars Willsen\'s Ambient Works</h2>\\n\\n<p>Many of these tracks can also be found on Lars Willsen\'s official YouTube channel: <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/@larswillsen/videos\\">Lars Willsen YouTube</a>.

One such moment for me took place in the mid-70s, aboard a Sikorsky S-61 helicopter flying over the remote wilderness of Greenland.</p>\\n\\n<p>We were returning home after spending a long summer in Denmark. My mother and two siblings had stayed behind and would follow later. Back then, travel between Greenlandic cities was often by helicopter, and this flight was no different. Departing from Kangerlussuaq (S\xf8ndre Str\xf8m), we were set to land in several towns along the way to drop off passengers and refuel. The helicopter was packed - fifteen passengers, plus two pilots and a mechanic. The front right seats had been removed to accommodate a large amount of mail. Among the passengers was my father’s cousin.</p>\\n\\n<p>Flying in Greenland is always unpredictable, but nothing could have prepared us for the storm we encountered that day. It struck without warning as we reached the Nuussuaq Peninsula, north of Disko Island. The Swedish pilots were known to be some of the best - hardcore professionals who had faced all manner of challenges. But even they struggled against the extreme winds. The helicopter was tossed around like a toy, fighting to maintain control. I wasn’t scared, not yet - my father sat beside me, looking completely calm despite the chaos unfolding around us. That calmness reassured me, even as we were slammed against our seatbelts.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then came the sounds - loud bangs like metal breaking apart, followed by an eerie screaming noise, as if something was being torn open. I turned to my father, searching his face for any sign of concern. He remained composed, but around us, passengers were beginning to panic. The pilots were locked in a desperate struggle against the storm, doing everything they could to regain stability.</p>\\n\\n<p>Suddenly, the helicopter began an unnatural slow spin. Something was terribly wrong. We descended rapidly, plummeting toward the landscape below. Then, with a bone-jarring impact, we crashed onto a sand basin nestled between towering mountains. The pilots wasted no time - engines were shut off immediately. The mechanic threw open the door and leapt out, followed by the rest of us, stumbling onto the cold, barren ground.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was my father’s cousin who first spotted it - the reason we were still alive. He pointed to the tail rudder shaft. The metal casing had been ripped wide open. The tail rotor - critical for stability - had nearly been sheared off. Just a few more inches, and we would have been sent into an uncontrollable spin, plummeting to certain death. The realization hit everyone at once. We had come within moments of disaster.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Strangers in the Storm</h2>\\n\\n<p>But then, something even stranger happened.</p>\\n\\n<p>We were stranded in the middle of nowhere, deep in an uninhabited stretch of Greenland. No settlements, no people - only mountains and the howling storm. And yet, someone was watching us.</p>\\n\\n<p><div style=\\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FTOxmzAp3s?si=tHHuphgxIkCGwGrR\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" \\n    referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" \\n    allowfullscreen \\n    style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\">\\n  </iframe>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<h2>Aftermath</h2>\\n\\n<p>The storm raged on. The pilots finally established radio contact, and hours later, another helicopter arrived to rescue us. We were flown to safety, but the encounter was never truly explained. Over the years, it was rarely spoken of - only mentioned in hushed conversations, with theories ranging from divine intervention to spirits of the land watching over us.</p>\\n\\n<p>To this day, I don’t know what I saw. But I know what I experienced. And that experience shaped me - after that day, there was little left in the world that could truly scare me.</p>\\n\\n<p>My song <em>Crash</em> is an instrumental piece inspired by that event. A memory of a near-fatal descent and the presence of something beyond explanation, standing in the storm, watching us from the shadows.</p>","date":"2025-03-11","excerpt":"","category":"Personal","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/chopper.png","imageAlt":"","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"957e9167-eb5c-4adc-ac3d-314441b22713","title":"Rootless: A Lost Album Reclaimed","slug":"rootless-a-lost-album-reclaimed","content":"<h2>The Long Road to Release</h2>\\n\\n<p>Some albums take years to make, others take decades to see the light of day. <em>Rootless</em> is one of those records that fell into the void of \'what could have been\' - until now. Originally recorded in 1989 and meant to be my first major release, it was buried due to an altercation with the label CEO in a Cardiff bar. Let\'s just say I wasn’t about to be pushed into the background as just \\"the synth player\\" in my own band.

On May 8th, 2024, <em>Rootless</em> finally got the release it deserved.

The truth is, I never showed up. I never collected the diploma, never stood in line with my classmates to mark the end of that chapter. While they celebrated, I was in a basement rehearsal room, writing a song called <em>Strong</em> - a song that I will finally release soon. When you hear it, you\'ll know exactly what was going through my mind that day.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Different Path</h2>\\n\\n<p>Most students went home that day, some traveling far away to their families. But somehow, I didn’t feel like I belonged there. It’s incredible to think about now, looking back more than 40 years later. Still, I did great afterward in a different way - through coding. I was lucky that I learned to program in assembly as a kid, and I can confidently say that skill alone shaped a huge part of my life. Later, I earned certifications from Stockholm University in computer science, mastering math-crunching like it was second nature. That was one of the reasons why the Swedish military took an interest in me.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Success and Excess</h2>\\n\\n<p>I lived most of my life alone. I wrote a million songs. Life was never easy for me. I was sent more than 3,000 miles away from home to attend school in Europe when I was very young. I was ripped away from my friends, from my roots. Looking back, sometimes I wish I had just stayed and lived a simple life. But fate had different plans.</p>\\n\\n<p>By the 90s, I was earning more than many top CEOs. And I partied just as hard. Sometimes I woke up in mental hospitals - not because I was mentally ill, but because of the extreme consequences of substance abuse. I saw it all, lived it all, and in the end, I found my wife. Since then, I have never partied like that again.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\\n\\n<p>Do I have regrets? No. But I did learn one thing: never give a second chance to those who did you wrong. I learned that early on, and it kept me on a path where nobody could touch me. Nobody can truly say they know me. Maybe one or two people have an idea, but the rest? They have no clue.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Life on the Move</h2>\\n\\n<p>As I mentioned, I worked in the Swedish military, and they gave me a cover job at a civilian IT company. That life took me all over - Lule\xe5, Uppsala, Stockholm, Kalmar, Malm\xf6, and places I barely remember. I lived in hotels as if they were home. My expenses were pre-paid, and somehow, I always managed to convince the bartenders to send bottles up to my room to knock me out after long and stressful coding sessions. I was so efficient that they let me do whatever I wanted. I have many stories - things most people will never experience. But I lived them all.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Looking Back</h2>\\n\\n<p>And now, here I am, sitting with a brain damaged from a recent stroke, reflecting on the life I’ve lived. Despite everything, I have a beautiful daughter. In the end, I really can’t ask for more.</p>\\n\\n<p>Greenland had no job opportunities for me - those levels in coding didn’t even exist, and they still don’t, as most IT work is outsourced to Danish companies. All of us who were sent to Denmark were misled by a school system run by Denmark. We were shuffled from school to school without any real purpose other than to graduate, only to end up working as ‘slaves’ for the administration back home. Banks and the government made it nearly impossible to start a business.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, instead, I traveled the world and learned a lot along the way. I have coded across most of Europe and North America and was even hired by major players when the Internet arrived in Denmark - almost two years after Sweden. At the time, there were the usual millionaires scrambling to claim the biggest share, some of them quite famous in Denmark. I won’t mention names, but a few of them still owe me a significant amount of money.</p>","date":"2025-03-08","excerpt":"","category":"Personal Life","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/synthfreak_The_Day_I_Chose_Music_Over_Graduation_a_dark_long__2537e379-5eab-49b8-accf-2dfbad201c82_2-2.png","imageAlt":"","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"90eeb0d8-5830-4bb0-a4d2-0dcdc1d06a88","title":"Writing Music After a Stroke: My Journey of Rediscovery","slug":"writing-music-after-a-stroke-my-journey-of-rediscovery","content":"<h2>Lost Chords and a New Reality</h2>\\n<p>Imagine listening to a track you once knew inside out, but now, you can’t connect three chords in rapid succession. You “see” the chords somewhere in your mind, but they slip away before you can string them together. That’s been my reality since a blood clot hit the left side of my brain. The doctors couldn’t dissolve it - it was too late. Yet, amidst the challenges, something unexpected happened: my tinnitus disappeared, and for the first time in decades, I could smell food while watching cooking videos.</p>\\n\\n<p>This newfound sensory clarity came with an odd side effect: I began to smell chords and see their colors in real-time. It’s as if my brain is compensating for what was lost, amplifying other senses to make up for the gaps.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Music and a Secret Past</h2>\\n<p>But back to music - my lifeline. In the mid-\'80s, I was a beta tester for Cubase, and I was good at it. Music was my world until an unfortunate event rendered my fingers unable to play keyboards. In response, I buried myself in my other passion: assembly coding. I coded for the Swedish military under a cover job that silenced my story for over 30 years. Not even my closest friends knew the truth. Music disappeared from my life entirely.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Chance Encounter</h2>\\n<p>Fast forward to 2021, when fate nudged me back. A chance encounter with someone who needed help with a music video reignited a dormant spark. I offered to help and ended up adding Hammond B3 organ parts using GarageBand. For the first time in over three decades, I touched a musical instrument. That small act snowballed into something life-changing. My wife and daughter gifted me a home studio for my 60th birthday, and I began re-recording thousands of tracks stored on ancient Atari floppy disks from my Cubase days.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Relearning Everything</h2>\\n<p>I had to relearn everything: how to use a DAW, play an instrument, and navigate the intricacies of modern music production - compression, EQ, effects, and more. By the end of 2022, I was making progress. And then, on December 18th, 2022, a massive stroke hit. Game over.</p>\\n\\n<p>Or so I thought.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Road to Recovery</h2>\\n<p>The recovery was grueling - 15 months of physiotherapy, relearning basic skills, and piecing my life back together with my wife fighting for me every step of the way. By the end of 2024, I found myself slowly building a new reality. Disability pension granted me some security, and though life is slower now, I’ve returned to making music, even releasing several tracks.</p>\\n\\n<p>It’s a lonely road. I’ve disconnected from social media, relying solely on YouTube to share my work. I haven’t seen or spoken to friends since the stroke, and my brain damage requires 10–12 hours of sleep nightly. Time flies, and I’m fighting harder than anyone can imagine - physically, emotionally, and creatively.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\\n<p>Music has become both a challenge and a salvation. I’ve had to start over twice, and while progress is slow, I’m still here. I go to the gym three times a week, exercise at home, and find joy in the small victories.

The fjord, once pristine, was tainted by the relentless pursuit of profit. The long-term effects of lead exposure are only now fully coming to light, as the people who called this place home struggle with health complications linked to that era.</p>\\n\\n    <p>The name <strong>\\"The Black Angel\\"</strong> isn\'t just symbolic; it carries the weight of corporate greed and environmental neglect. Lead poisoning is a silent destroyer, and the track serves as a stark reminder of the cost of unchecked industrial activity. It’s a story that needs to be told, and sometimes, the most powerful way to tell it is through music.</p>\\n\\n    <p>This song isn’t just about looking back - it’s about raising awareness. The agenda behind these operations is clear: depopulation of small settlements to make way for large-scale resource extraction. The pattern repeats, and those in power continue to ignore the real consequences, while local pseudo-activists and academics from the south enable the status quo instead of fighting for real change.</p>\\n\\n    <h2>Musical Elements</h2>\\n\\n    <p>Musically, <strong>\\"The Black Angel\\"</strong> is built on deep, resonant tones that echo the weight of its message.

They traveled from what is now Russia - crossing the Bering Strait - onward to Alaska, and eventually, some of them, including my own lineage, made their way to Greenland. This long, perilous migration inspires much of the imagery behind the melody, transforming it into a cinematic dreamscape that speaks of survival, triumph, and the human spirit.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Origins of the Composition</h2>\\n<p>The melody for \\"I am Nomad\\" was first created during a time when I could still play the piano with ease. Unfortunately, I lost much of my piano-playing ability after a parasitic infection in the late 1980s, which coincidentally happened around the time I was auditioning for the band Pretty Maids. Despite the setback, I continued my musical journey using different tools. Recently, I turned to EZkeys 2 software to help replicate the chords and voicings of the original piece, ensuring I could capture the song’s essence just as I had first conceived it.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Tribute to Inuit Resilience</h2>\\n<p>The main theme of \\"I am Nomad\\" is the resilience and courage of the Inuit who made that treacherous journey millennia ago. It is no small feat to survive and thrive in such harsh environments. My ancestors, as some family stories go, joined a later migration that reached Greenland around 500-1,000 years ago, while others arrived approximately 1,000 years earlier from Canada. In my dreams, I often relive the dangers of those times. There is an inexplicable familiarity with places I have never physically visited, and I sometimes wonder if these memories are preserved in our genes or carried on frequencies beyond our understanding.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Embracing Fears - and the Bears</h2>\\n<p>A recurring element in these dreams is the presence of bears. I have always had a deep-seated fear of them, yet I once found myself on a bear hunt in Alaska without any intention to kill. Strangely enough, the bears seemed to sense this - they left us alone, almost as if they understood we meant them no harm. This idea of mutual respect and connection with nature also weaves its way into the music of \\"I am Nomad,\\" especially through the use of the Inuit drum and the inclusion of original vocal techniques reminiscent of our traditional songs.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Instrumentation and Collaboration</h2>\\n<p>Originally, the melody was played solely on the piano. However, after losing my childhood friend and renowned musician Peter Leibhardt, I felt drawn to replace certain piano lines with an acoustic guitar. This decision was both emotional and practical - the piano parts were already quite demanding, and the guitar lent a warm, human touch that felt right for honoring Peter’s memory. Additionally, I used strings from Crow Hill companies\' \\"The Vault\\" series to create the layered, atmospheric backdrop. Together, the drum, acoustic guitar, and carefully arranged orchestration aim to paint a sonic picture of our ancestors’ journey and the fragile beauty of the Arctic landscapes they crossed.</p>\\n\\n<h2>From Music to Coding - A Life in Two Worlds</h2>\\n<p>Following my abrupt departure from the music scene due to my hand injury, I transitioned into a career as a hardcore coder. My work spanned a range of fields and even involved projects for the Swedish military, among other organizations worldwide. Yet, music never truly left my heart. Now at 62, revisiting \\"I am Nomad\\" feels like stepping back into a part of myself that was left behind but never lost.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Reflections on the Journey</h2>\\n<p>Today, as I continue to dream of distant tundras, formidable mountain passes, and the sounds of wolves echoing across frozen landscapes, I feel more certain than ever that \\"I am Nomad\\" is more than just a song. It is a musical time capsule that carries the spirit of our Arctic odyssey, the persistent will of our ancestors, and the profound mystery of cultural memory. Whether you are Inuit or from a completely different background, I hope that listening to \\"I am Nomad\\" offers a momentary glimpse into the grandeur, danger, and triumph that shaped not only my forebears but also the person I have become. After decades spent apart from piano, it has been a true blessing to revisit this composition and share a piece of our rich, enduring legacy.</p>\\n\\n<p>This song is dedicated to my childhood friend, Anders Samuelsen, whom we sadly lost to the sea in a boat accident - loved and never forgotten.</p>\\n","date":"2025-02-27","excerpt":"","category":"Songs","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/i-am-nomad-inuit-lars-willsen.png","imageAlt":"I am Nomad, a song about my Inuit ancestors and their long journey crossing the land bridge and all the way to Greenland","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"silent-strings-eternal-legacy","title":"Silent Strings Eternal Legacy - A Journey of Music and Code","slug":"silent-strings-eternal-legacy-a-journey-of-music-and-code","content":"<p>In the vibrant music scene of the 1980s, I was known as a hardrocker, sharing the stage and studio with numerous musicians who would go on to become legends. Yet, there was another side to my life, one that few knew about. While my friends and bandmates saw me as a musician, I was also deeply immersed in the world of coding, a craft I had mastered at a time when it was still a mysterious art. My expertise in 8088 and x86 processors made me a sought-after freelance coder, with companies and even the Swedish military seeking my skills to transform bulky code into efficient, compact masterpieces.</p>\\n<h2>The Dual Life of a Coder-Musician</h2>\\n<p>The 1980s were a whirlwind of music and coding. By day, I was a \\\\\\"normal\\\\\\" guy, hanging out with friends, jamming with my band, and living what seemed to be a regular life. But at night, I would retreat into the world of assembly language, crafting game engines, optimizing military software, and even dabbling in early neural networks for AI. The cover job provided by the military allowed me to delve into multimedia projects, simulating civilian infrastructure, and creating learning programs, all under the guise of a public role.</p>\\n<p>Most of my friends, especially those in Sweden, were unaware of my coding endeavors. They saw me as a multimedia enthusiast, a perception that suited me fine. It allowed me to keep my two worlds separate, even from those closest to me. This secretive life extended to my relationships; not even my girlfriends knew what I was truly working on. While the world around me was evolving, I was constantly creating, both in the realm of code and music.</p>\\n<h2>A Musician\'s Struggle and Triumph</h2>\\n<p>Throughout this period, I continued to write and produce music, pouring my soul into over 800 tracks, many of which were saved as MIDI files with accompanying lyrics. However, the bands I played with often lacked the drive I had, resulting in frustration and unmet potential. Despite the challenges, I released an album titled <em>Rootless</em>, though it never gained the distribution it deserved.</p>\\n<p>The music industry was tough, filled with prima donnas who refused to play small venues and vocalists who couldn’t write lyrics, much less speak English fluently. These obstacles led to multiple rejections from record labels, even when they initially expressed interest in our material. My passion for music was met with skepticism, both from those within the industry and from former friends who couldn’t understand how I could produce so much music so quickly.</p>\\n<h2>The Silent Saboteur</h2>\\n<p>One of the most disheartening discoveries came much later. As I released more of my music in recent years, I noticed a pattern - one of my late friends consistently disliked my tracks. This hurt, especially because I had dedicated an album to him before he passed. After his death, the dislikes stopped, confirming my suspicions. It was a painful realization that someone I had considered a friend was actively working against me, yet it didn’t deter me. I knew that my music wasn’t just for public acclaim; it was a legacy I wanted to leave for my daughter, Freya.</p>\\n<h2>Legacy of Code and Melody</h2>\\n<p>The parasitic infection that struck in the early 1990s ended my music career prematurely, rendering my fingers unable to play for over 30 years. During this time, I focused on my coding career, working with companies worldwide and contributing to projects that ranged from video games to military systems. But my love for music never faded. After recovering some use of my hands, I re-recorded the tracks from <em>Rootless</em> and released them, fulfilling a promise to myself and my daughter.</p>\\n<p>My story is one of resilience, of balancing a double life that few knew about, and of creating a legacy that will endure long after I’m gone. Despite the setbacks, the betrayals, and the physical challenges, I’ve succeeded in what matters most: leaving behind a body of work that speaks to my passion, both in music and in code. Today, as I reflect on my journey, I know that I did it all for Freya, and that is enough.</p>\\n","date":"2024-02-20","excerpt":"In the vibrant music scene of the 1980s, I was known as a hardrocker, sharing the stage and studio with numerous musicians who would go on to become l...","category":"Personal Story","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/lars-willsen-1988.png","imageAlt":"Lars Willsen in 1988","imageAttribution":"Photo","socialImage":null},{"id":"pretty-maids-audition","title":"Pretty Maids Audition - A Story of Persistence","slug":"pretty-maids-audition-a-story-of-persistence","content":"<h2>The Hospital and the Call</h2>\\n<p>In the late \'90s, I was at Nyborg hospital with swollen fingers. The doctors couldn\'t figure out why - it was later discovered to be a parasitic infection, possibly from one of my many trips to exotic parts of the world.</p>\\n<p>While I was at the hospital, a nurse came and told me that someone had called, said it was important, and would call again in a quarter of an hour. The nurse brought the phone in (we didn\'t have mobile phones back then) and plugged it in.</p>\\n<p>I waited for a moment before it rang. I answered the phone, and on the other end was Ken Hammer, whom I knew through Rick Hanson, with whom I had played before. During our many trips to Aarhus, where Rick lived, we often stopped by Horsens to visit Ken. We had many mutual acquaintances, but I was surprised why he was calling me while I was in the hospital - it must have been important... and it was, at least in my world.</p>\\n<p>Ken asked directly, \\"How\'s it going?\\"<br>\\n\\"Hey, Lars... do you want to play with us? Allan has dropped out, and we need a keyboard player...\\"<br>\\nI asked, \\"When?\\"<br>\\nKen replied, \\"Yeah, tomorrow?\\"</p>\\n<p>Haha... I said I could do it once I was discharged from the hospital, and that was fine. I discharged myself to go home and go through the songs that I already knew.</p>\\n<p>I had played all their songs under various circumstances, and also because I played with Rick Hanson, it was obvious to play <em>Red Hot &amp; Heavy</em> with Hammond organ. Interestingly, it was at a time when I was coding for a host of foreign companies and, on the side, writing my music - which was never recorded, but I\'ve refreshed many of them here in 2022 - 24.</p>\\n<p>When I was ready and had rehearsed all their songs (the ones with synths, because not all have synths), I went to Horsens.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Attack at the Train Station in Horsens</h2>\\n<p>When I arrived at Horsens train station, I was attacked in the station tunnel between the platforms by two drunks - a big guy and a small annoying sidekick. He kicked out at me and called me a junkie, but I deflected the kick, dropped my keyboard, which lost a key so that it was only half attached.</p>\\n<p>I then kicked the big guy right between the legs as hard as I could, sure that I busted his balls. He fell directly to the ground, clutching his balls. The little one tried again, acting like a rabid fox terrier. I blocked one of his punches and threw a punch to his throat. It was meant to go up into his nose, but he was drunk and ducked down, so I ended up hitting his throat so hard that he too was out of the picture.</p>\\n<p>I grabbed my keyboard and ran up the stairs. Near the exit, I ran into an empty DSB restaurant on the right side. There was a waitress who was startled by my entrance. I quickly told her that I had been attacked and that they were probably after me. She quickly guided me behind a partition.</p>\\n<p>She said that the two guys had stormed past and out into the square and that I should just stay where I was. She asked if she should call the police, but I said no because I had an audition with Pretty Maids. She looked at me - and she knew who Pretty Maids were.</p>\\n<p>When the two idiots were gone, she offered to let me use their phone. I called Ken Hammer and explained that I had been attacked and was a little late. It didn\'t matter much because I was supposed to go to his apartment, and from there, we were to drive to the rehearsal room in the city.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Preparation and Audition</h2>\\n<p>I knew all their songs since a friend introduced me to them many years earlier at Gertrud Rask\'s dormitory in Odense. He had the first album with the demons and also <em>Red Hot &amp; Heavy</em>, which was significantly better than the first.</p>\\n<p>I think the reason they called me was that Rick Hanson had vouched for me - I played with Rick up until that time in Nyborg, along with the later drummer Mike Fast. I think Michael had also mentioned me, but it was before his time with them.</p>\\n<p>I had refreshed their songs the day before, and it went okay, though I couldn\'t hear myself. As mentioned, I knew their songs well enough to play them in my sleep. When I was there, they had just recorded <em>Jump the Gun</em> (<em>Lethal Heroes</em> in the USA).</p>\\n<p>The second time I went up there, I recorded the intro to <em>Lethal Heroes</em> on my Atari using only the JX-3P. Even though the sounds weren\'t quite the same, Zumme (Paul aka Ronnie Atkins) liked it. He listened from the hallway and came in, seemingly surprised that I had taken the time to do it, given that it was only an audition.</p>\\n<p>But they called me back again; they probably had a lot of people trying out during that time. I was called in a couple more times, and during that period, Ken had moved out to a large house on Koralvej in Horsens, where I slept on his sofa.</p>\\n<p>I didn\'t have a penny on me, and when Ken left to run errands in Aarhus, I had to find something to eat. I\'m not the type to rummage through people\'s things, so I grabbed a bunch of dry spaghetti and ate it raw. I know from experience that spaghetti expands after a while. I\'ve learned this from being a Greenlander without money in Denmark. When it was luxurious, they were cooked, and you got ketchup on them - and if it was really special, there was mustard too.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The End of the Journey</h2>\\n<p>Ken drove me to the rehearsal room early because he had some errands in Aarhus, I think. Here I was, all alone in the rehearsal room without a key.</p>\\n<p>In a backroom of their rehearsal space, there were tons of deposit bottles, so I thought I could allow myself to borrow a few bags. It was back when liter bottles were glass, so I filled two or three bags with them. I knew there was a supermarket nearby, but without a key, it was a bit tricky.</p>\\n<p>I found a stick and set it between the door so it wouldn\'t lock and went to the store, where I bought some cigarettes (a 10-pack), some discounted cold cuts, and water. It was a bit of a gamble because if there had been thieves, they would have had free access to a lot of expensive gear - but hey, I had a good feeling, and fortunately, nothing happened.</p>\\n<p>Henrik (Moorhead), the former drummer, drove me to the station so I could catch the last train to Fyn. On the train, I was in the last car and ran into some extremist guy - he was pretty intrusive, grilling me about where I was from.</p>\\n<p>I had an old trick from before and told him I was from Ireland (I had worked in Dublin in the early \'80s and could easily throw out some words). He bought it and then asked why I had a keyboard with me. I just casually said that I had just bought it used and didn\'t know if it worked (the key was still missing).</p>\\n<p>I couldn\'t get rid of him, and then he pulled out vodka from a backpack and asked if we were going to party...<br>\\n\\"Sure,\\" I said, and we sat there singing Irish drinking songs for an hour until I had to get off at Nyborg.</p>\\n<p>I had to go to Horsens again after a while, and I was to attend a party being held at Ken\'s new house. I don\'t remember much from that evening/night, but I did get home.</p>\\n<p>My fingers had started swelling again, so I talked to my dad about what I should do. He advised me to be honest and not put them in a situation where I might have to cancel if I joined. I then called Ken and explained that I was having the same problem as the day he called and that I unfortunately had to back out completely.</p>\\n<p>Ken thought it was a shame but was very understanding, and we hung up. Only after 30+ years have I started again, at least with my own songs from back then... they speak for themselves.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Songs I wrote during that period</h2>\\n\\n<p>I actually wrote these two on my JX-3P .. the one that also got smashed, but I auditioned with it anyhow:</p><ul><li><a href=\\"https:\\\\\\\\/\\\\\\\\/www.youtube.com\\\\\\\\/watch?v=N38WHfPxOG8\\\\\\">Fearless (Dedicated to Ronnie Atkins)</a></li><li><a href=\\"https:\\\\\\\\/\\\\\\\\/www.youtube.com\\\\\\\\/watch?v=BaXyRpPaRd4\\\\\\">Long Time Ago In The Future (Dedicated to Ken Hammer)</a></li></ul>\\n\\n\\n","date":"2024-02-19","excerpt":"The Hospital and the CallIn the late \'90s, I was at Nyborg hospital with swollen fingers.

With polished words and empty gestures, they appease local power brokers, enabling more destruction. They speak of unity while deepening the divide. They publish reports while communities die slowly.

With <em>Future Frequencies</em>, Lars Willsen doesn’t just revisit that sound - he resurrects it.</p>\\n<p>This 7-track release is not a nostalgia trip. It’s a <em>restoration</em> — a deeply personal recovery of music written in the 1980s but only now reimagined and recorded with the maturity, insight, and production edge of a lifetime lived.</p>\\n<p>Willsen’s sonic world is built on genuine synth rock and synthwave aesthetics — cascading arpeggios, rich analog pads, punchy retro drums — but the core of <em>Future Frequencies</em> lies not in the tools, but in the <em>feel</em>. This is music forged in the fires of experience, pain, survival, love, and reflection.</p>\\n<p>Each track is its own emotional novella — a short story dressed in synth textures and melodic precision. The songs don\'t just play — they <em>speak</em>.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Vertigo</h2>\\n<p>You’re standing on the edge — the skyline buzzing below you, the wind howling in your ears. <em>Vertigo</em> is adrenaline and fear dancing in unison. It’s the thrill of height, of danger, of the surreal calm that comes from staring modernity in the face from above. This opener sets the tone: cinematic, tense, and utterly captivating.</p>\\n\\n<h2>I\'ll Be Your Angel</h2>\\n<p>What if love doesn’t end with death? What if you could stay, unseen, to guide and protect the ones you leave behind? <em>I’ll Be Your Angel</em> offers comfort wrapped in shimmering synths — a ballad of devotion that transcends the grave. It’s as gentle as it is powerful, echoing through memory and the great beyond.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Without You</h2>\\n<p>A planet turns, but something’s missing. <em>Without You</em> drifts through space — not physical space, but emotional isolation. It’s the soundtrack to a universe that no longer feels like home. Minimalist yet lush, lonely yet resolute, this track is the quiet anthem of anyone who’s ever had to find their footing again in a world turned upside down.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Rejected</h2>\\n<p>Creative rejection is a wound most artists carry. <em>Rejected</em> wears that wound openly, not in bitterness, but in brutal honesty. The lyrics offer no sugarcoating — only the reassurance of one heart that never doubted: his wife\'s. The track balances vulnerability with strength, reflecting Willsen’s resilience and the steady hand that helped him hold on.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Dead On Arrival</h2>\\n<p>Few songs dare to be this real. <em>Dead On Arrival</em> tells the story of a friend who died en route to the hospital — a moment etched in Willsen’s life and now in his music. It’s haunting without being morbid, respectful without being distant. The synths breathe and grieve with him, shaping an elegy that’s as honest as it is unforgettable.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Colorfill World</h2>\\n<p>A protest song with laser focus, <em>Colorfill World</em> strikes at ignorance and its destructive offspring: hate. The message is blunt — “people are evil because they’re stupid” — and the music backs it up with defiant, electrifying energy. It’s a danceable outcry, a synthwave rebellion wrapped in color and clarity.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Savannah</h2>\\n<p>Closing the album is a journey — a glowing, synth-soaked voyage through the rhythms and colors of Africa. <em>Savannah</em> feels like film score and memory combined, with tribal echoes and sunset tones swirling into a final statement. This is not the end — it’s the horizon, endlessly wide and full of possibility.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Legacy Resurfaced</h2>\\n<p><em>Future Frequencies</em> isn’t just an album. It’s the sound of buried treasure being unearthed. Written in a time when these tools were new and raw, and brought to life now with wisdom and polish, these songs form a bridge between past and present — between the artist Willsen was, and the artist he has become.</p>\\n<p>The synths may sound vintage, but the message, emotion, and execution are timeless. Whether you lived through the 80s or are just discovering its magic, <em>Future Frequencies</em> offers an authentic, soul-tuned portal into its melodic depths.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Watch the Full Album</h2>\\n<p>\uD83C\uDFA7 <strong>Experience the complete sonic journey below.</strong></p>\\n<p>See more at <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk\\" target=\\"_blank\\">https://willsen.dk</a></p>\\n\\n<div class=\\"youtube-container\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/takSrPT_22w\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" \\n    allowfullscreen>\\n  </iframe>\\n</div>","date":"2025-06-02","excerpt":"There’s something timeless about the analog pulse of the 1980s ...","category":"Music","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/future-frequencies-1200x675-1.png","imageAlt":"Future Frequencies: Reclaiming the Synth Heart of the 80s","imageAttribution":"Artwork","socialImage":null},{"id":"post-1748925641217","title":"Reality in Greenland - What They Don’t Want to Remember","slug":"reality-in-greenland-what-they-don-t-want-to-remember","content":"<h2>A Childhood Full of Music</h2>\\n<p>\\nI was born in Qullissat and raised in Uummannaq. Our house was filled with music - tape recordings, guitars, and a piano. My dad played guitar and organ, my mom had been taught piano as a child, and my sister played all the pop hits of the 70s. We had a vinyl player like most families back then - the Beatles, Sinatra, Streisand, and many others spun through our speakers.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nI can’t recall my first record, but I do remember the day my mom returned from Denmark with two cassettes that changed everything - Thin Lizzy’s <em>Live & Dangerous</em> and Boston’s <em>Don’t Look Back</em>. Those tapes became the soundtrack of my youth. Even before then, I had a tiny out-of-tune toy piano where I started creating music. I dreamed of becoming a musician one day - and in some way, I did.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Friendships, Music - and Dividing Lines</h2>\\n<p>\\nI wrote songs with childhood friends Peter Leibhardt and Frederik Nielsen. We were in the same class. Frederik came from Qullissat like me. His father was a baker, which made him popular - he brought sweet treats none of us could resist. Peter was incredibly talented, and we all learned advanced chords from his older brother Karl.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nI also had family who were local legends - like Peter B. Johansen, a poet and troubadour with an endless well of songs. On the surface, everything seemed bright, but there were dark undercurrents. Greenland was changing - politically, socially, and emotionally.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Political Divide and Its Toll</h2>\\n<p>\\nAs politics took over adult lives, our community fractured. The “extreme left”, the “other left”, and the “centre” - people began to label each other and take sides. Youth returning from schools were fired up about political identity. As a half-Dane, I became a target in this game of misplaced frustration. My dad entered politics and even became the mayor. So did Peter’s dad. But politics wasn’t the real enemy.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nAlcohol was. It seeped into every household, into every adult. It turned warmth into chaos. I saw it firsthand. My dad, like many others, lost himself in drink. We learned to lock ourselves in bathrooms when he erupted. Every home had hunting weapons - for seals and whales - so every outburst carried real danger.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Trauma That No One Spoke About</h2>\\n<p>\\nI saw things no child should see. I watched a friend die from a gunshot wound - we tried to hold in his entrails, but he was already gone. I saw another friend crushed under a tower of pallets - his eyes burst, blood poured from his ears. We pulled the wood off his body and I threw up from the horror. We lived with these images.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nBut no adult ever stepped in. Teachers, principals, local leaders - none of them asked, none offered help. We were left to grow up fast or not at all. I will never forgive them for that silence.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Defiance and Survival</h2>\\n<p>\\nWe were beaten by older kids, hunted by drunk men with rifles - but they couldn’t scare us. I didn’t care if I died. That’s how numb we were from everything the adults failed to protect us from. And when threatened even today, that same fire returns - it’s not for show, it’s survival instinct.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Music They Tried to Ignore</h2>\\n<p>\\nMusic was my escape. I played in many bands, some now considered legendary. But nobody noticed my solo work - the side projects I kept hidden for years. Those are the songs you can hear now. I released them decades later, after surviving long enough to do it. For my daughter. For my 92-year-old mom, who started it all.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\nStill, no one from my music past came back. Not one. It’s as if I never existed. But I did. I do. And my catalog is too big to be buried. Let them deny it. When I’m gone, they don’t get to rewrite my legacy. My family knows. The music knows. And it’s out there - permanently.\\n</p>","date":"2025-06-03","excerpt":"A raw, unfiltered reflection on growing up in Greenland - music, trauma, survival, and a legacy denied by those who never dared to face the truth.","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/synthfreak_Reality_in_Greenland_-_What_They_Dont_Want_to_Reme_08f04eab-e44a-4d14-9497-a0cb215d594d_3-2.png","imageAlt":"Reality in Greenland - What They Don’t Want to Remember","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null},{"id":"post-1748937345386","title":"The Silent Strategists: Rethinking Warfare Through Creative Minds","slug":"the-silent-strategists-rethinking-warfare-through-creative-minds","content":"<h2>The Power of Unspoiled Thinking</h2>\\n<p>\\nIn the world of defense and strategic innovation, the most powerful minds are not always the most experienced - often, they are the youngest. Free from decades of structured thinking and formal doctrine, young people are capable of imagining the impossible. These minds don’t calculate risk the same way a seasoned general does - they explore possibilities with a clean slate, where “what if” becomes “why not.” This playful, experimental mindset has become an invaluable tool in scenarios where traditional logic falls short.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>From Skunk Works to Playground Tactics</h2>\\n<p>\\nIn many ways, the creativity used in military research projects mirrors the open, curious nature of childhood experimentation. Historical \\"Skunk Works\\" initiatives, where unconventional solutions were tested far from public view, have evolved into strategic environments that welcome creative chaos. Today, it’s not uncommon for intelligence or defense agencies to simulate enemy threats and ask simple minds to find simple - yet incredibly effective - solutions. These aren’t war games with tanks and missiles; they’re more like puzzles with real-world consequences.\\n</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\"youtube-container\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMb8nOhiRDk\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\\" \\n    allowfullscreen>\\n  </iframe>\\n</div>\\n\\n<h2>Hiding in Plain Sight: The Unexpected Advantage</h2>\\n<p>\\nOne of the most effective strategies in modern warfare is to leverage the ordinary. Everyday trucks, fruit deliveries, or construction vehicles can serve as covert platforms for advanced capabilities. The more familiar something looks, the less attention it attracts - and that makes it powerful. A truck that blends into city traffic can, in theory, launch drones without detection, disrupt key infrastructure, or disable critical assets in the heart of an adversary’s territory. This tactic isn\'t limited to espionage thrillers - it\'s part of today’s strategic thinking.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Looking Beyond Borders</h2>\\n<p>\\nIn conflicts like the ongoing war in Ukraine, the challenge isn\'t simply protecting territory. The real objective is to disrupt the enemy\'s core operations - rail hubs, logistics networks, power stations - all buried deep within national borders. By adopting unconventional delivery systems, Ukraine and others can project influence far beyond front lines. These methods don’t rely on sheer force, but on subtlety, surprise, and scale. This asymmetric approach redefines the concept of reach and turns limitation into opportunity.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Myth of the General as the Idea Machine</h2>\\n<p>\\nMilitary leadership, while essential for coordination and execution, is not always the best source for disruptive innovation. In many modern operations, the role of top brass is to validate and implement - not invent. That responsibility is increasingly handed to diverse teams of creative minds, tech developers, and yes, even children, who are less constrained by precedent. The future of defense will not be won with tradition, but with adaptation. It’s no longer about what’s been done - it’s about what could be done.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Targeting Weak Links: Infrastructure and Information</h2>\\n<p>\\nModern conflict doesn’t always require tanks or troops. Attacking digital infrastructure, such as undersea cables, data centers, or satellite links, can cause disruption more effectively than a conventional strike. These vulnerabilities are often public knowledge - the problem lies in preparing for them. Coastal regions with exposed cabling, for instance, represent soft targets for adversaries with plausible deniability. Protecting these assets requires not just defense spending, but innovative foresight.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Diplomacy and the Long Game</h2>\\n<p>\\nThe political landscape is shifting fast. Nations like Poland are approaching elections that could redefine their alliances. The unpredictability of global leaders, including potential changes in U.S. policy, has introduced new risks for dependent partners. For countries like Ukraine, this underscores the importance of operating with increasing independence, building alliances beyond politics, and investing in strategies that are resilient to sudden change. Strategic independence is no longer optional - it’s essential.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The “Cheese Test”: How to Spot the Unexpected</h2>\\n<p>\\nSometimes the earliest warning signs of disruption are the smallest. Imagine a rural area where cheese suddenly disappears from shelves - it’s not about the cheese. It’s about disruption, scarcity, and behavioral shifts. These patterns, if read correctly, offer early insights into larger movements at play. When something seemingly unimportant changes without explanation, it may be a signal worth investigating. Intelligence, in this context, is not about complexity - it’s about awareness.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>A New Kind of Patriotism</h2>\\n<p>\\nIn times of instability, the call to serve your country doesn’t always come in uniform. It comes in ideas - sharp, strange, and sometimes disruptive ones. Every country has weak points, and every enemy has blind spots. It’s not about brute force anymore - it’s about thinking faster, hiding smarter, and acting before the obvious is even visible. Yesterday’s wars were fought with rifles. Tomorrow’s might be won by the minds still learning how the world works - precisely because they haven’t yet been told what’s impossible.\\n</p>\\n","date":"2025-05-09","excerpt":"Creative minds are reshaping modern warfare with unexpected tactics, everyday tools, and strategic insight beyond traditional military thinking.","category":"News","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/math-of-war.png","imageAlt":"The Silent Strategists: Rethinking Warfare Through Creative Minds","imageAttribution":"Artwork: AI","socialImage":null}],"about":{"title":"About Lars Willsen - Synthplayer, Producer & Songwriter","content":"<p>Lars Willsen is a <strong>Greenlandic-Inuit rock musician, synth virtuoso, and producer</strong>, known for blending Arctic storytelling with the <strong>bold, cinematic textures of 80s synth music</strong>.
