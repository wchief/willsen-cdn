But today’s heavy subgenres thrive on electronic elements. Industrial metal, for example, often blends mechanical beats with electronic bass sequences. Similarly, electronicore fuses metalcore/djent with EDM influences, featuring breakdowns alongside trance and dubstep-style synths. Modern metal bands are no strangers to synth sounds – and many are starting to integrate synthesized bass lines as a core component of their sound.</p>\\n<p>One reason is the quest for an ultra-clear, punishing low end that traditional bass guitars sometimes struggle to provide in extreme tunings. Synth bass allows for floor-shaking sub-bass frequencies and tonal consistency that guitar pickups can’t always match. In genres like djent – where guitars often extend into bass territory – a synth bass can fill in the subsonic gaps, ensuring the mix never loses impact. The result is a tight, modern sound where bass drops, wobbles, and pulsating electronic grooves can coexist with heavy riffs.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Creative and Sonic Advantages of Synth Bass</h2>\\n<p>Incorporating a dedicated synth bassist unlocks a world of creative possibilities:</p>\\n<ul>\\n  <li><strong>Wider Sonic Palette:</strong> A synth can produce an endless array of tones – from deep sinusoidal sub-bass to distorted sawtooth growls – far beyond what a typical bass guitar can do.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Consistent Power:</strong> Synth bass delivers pure, consistent low frequencies that hit hard, even at extreme tunings.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Layering & Production:</strong> In the studio, synth bass is perfect for layering with DI bass, side-chaining, and applying effects like filter sweeps or modulation.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Quick Adaptability:</strong> Presets and MIDI control let the synth bassist change tones instantly to suit different songs or sections.</li>\\n  <li><strong>Augmenting Guitars:</strong> Synth bass doesn’t have to replace bass guitar – it can double riffs, sustain drones, or fill out choruses for dramatic effect.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Synth Bass in the Studio: Modern Metal Production</h2>\\n<p>In studio recordings, synth bass has quietly become a secret weapon for many metal producers. Even bands that still use bass guitar often blend in synth bass to achieve the massive tone modern listeners expect. It’s common to layer a DI bass with a filtered sawtooth synth bass, or use a side-chained 808-style line under the kick for maximum punch.</p>\\n<p>One standout example is “Sleepwalkers” by Aphyxion. The track (from their 2019 album <em>Void</em>) merges melodic guitar work with brooding electronic undercurrents. Subtle synths build atmosphere, while huge low-end swells give it modern edge. It’s a textbook example of how synth bass can elevate metal production to cinematic levels. <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FdYh99wnfY\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">Watch Sleepwalkers on YouTube</a>.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Synth Bass on Stage: A Live Game-Changer</h2>\\n<p>Bringing synth bass into live performances breathes new life into metal concerts. While backing tracks can handle basic synth layers, a dedicated synth bassist offers something far better: real-time control and human presence. They can headbang, interact with the crowd, and improvise transitions or effects live, adapting to the energy of the show.</p>\\n<p>Live synth bass players also enhance the mix. They can fine-tune filters, adjust to the acoustics of the venue, and switch between roles – playing sub-bass in one song and ambient textures in the next. It’s like adding a fifth member who commands the electronic dimension of your sound, without sacrificing live authenticity.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Case Study: “Sleepwalkers” – Synth-Driven Metal in Action</h2>\\n<p>“Sleepwalkers” by Aphyxion is a masterclass in modern metal enhanced by synth elements. The synth bass gives the song an epic feel without undermining the heaviness. While the band uses backing tracks live, imagine the added impact of a visible synth player delivering those sounds in real time. The atmosphere would become even more immersive and the performance more compelling.</p>\\n\\n<h2>My Fusion-Metal Style with Inuit Drumming</h2>\\n<p>In addition to heavy synth bass, I bring a unique fusion-metal sound that incorporates traditional <strong>Inuit native drumming</strong> – a deep rhythmic tradition that adds raw primal power and spiritual resonance to modern metal compositions.</p>\\n<p>This style is featured in my original tracks where synth bass drives the core while Inuit drums amplify the energy and atmosphere. For example:</p>\\n<ul>\\n  <li><a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHcySkJoXZ0\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">Watch “Konspirazy” on YouTube</a> – a driving fusion of metal riffing, synth bass, and native pulse.</li>\\n  <li><a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDbDweeB91Q\\\\\\" target=\\\\\\"_blank\\\\\\">Watch “Backstage Secret” on YouTube</a> – showcasing cinematic intensity blended with native grooves and synth low-end.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>These tracks represent how traditional cultural roots and cutting-edge electronic metal can meet to form a distinctive, genre-blending sound.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Embrace the Synth Bass Revolution – Elevate Your Band’s Sound</h2>\\n<p>Synth bass is not just a background layer anymore – it’s a core element of modern metal. Whether you’re producing industrial grooves, electronicore breakdowns, or progressive soundscapes, a synth bassist can be your secret weapon.</p>\\n<p><strong>I am a dedicated synth bass player available for both studio sessions and live performances.</strong> I bring years of experience blending analog and digital synthesis with the power of metal. Let’s collaborate to take your music to the next level – with sounds that rumble floors and push boundaries.</p>\\n<p><strong>Get in touch now</strong> to explore how I can contribute to your next release or live show.

This “Voie des Cristalliers” on the mountain’s north side is considered the least technical ascent, but it is extremely popular and far from trivial. In the mid-1990s (before recent permit quotas), summer seasons saw up to ~200 climbers per day on this normal route, often causing congestion at narrow passages. A fit, experienced mountain walker would typically plan a 3-day round trip: two nights in alpine huts (or camps) and a summit bid at dawn on day two or three. Below is a stage-by-stage route summary, including trail names, huts, elevation data, terrain progression, and key hazard zones as they were in the 1990s.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Day 1: Chamonix to T\xeate Rousse Hut (1,035 m → 3,167 m)</h2>\\n<p>The journey begins in the village of Chamonix (alt. ~1,035 m), foregoing any cable cars or trains. Hikers often follow local footpaths or sections of the GR5/TMB (Tour du Mont Blanc) route to reach Les Houches. From Les Houches, a classic hiking trail climbs through pine forest and alpine meadows up to the Col de Voza (1,653 m). After a few hours, you reach the Nid d’Aigle (“Eagle’s Nest”) at 2,372\xa0m. Above this point, the trail climbs a lateral moraine and rocky slopes to the foot of the T\xeate Rousse Glacier. After approximately 2 hours of ascent, you arrive at the Refuge de T\xeate Rousse (3,167\xa0m), a common first night stop. By the end of Day\xa01 you’ve gained roughly +2,100\xa0m in elevation.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Day 2: Grand Couloir, Go\xfbter Ridge, and Summit Push (3,167 m → 4,807 m)</h2>\\n<p>Climbers depart T\xeate Rousse around 1–2 AM to cross the Grand Couloir at its safest, coldest time. The couloir is a hazardous rockfall zone that must be crossed one by one. After this, the climb continues up the Go\xfbter Ridge — a 600\xa0m rock scramble to the Refuge du Go\xfbter (3,835\xa0m). After a short rest and preparation, climbers rope up to ascend the D\xf4me du Go\xfbter (4,304\xa0m), pass the Vallot Emergency Shelter (4,362\xa0m), and begin the narrow, exposed Bosses Ridge. The final ascent is a steady trudge up to the Mont Blanc summit (~4,807 m). Climbers typically descend to Go\xfbter or T\xeate Rousse the same day.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Day 3: Descent to Chamonix (3,167 m → 1,035 m)</h2>\\n<p>Day\xa03 is the return to Chamonix. From T\xeate Rousse, climbers retrace their steps via Nid d’Aigle, Col de Voza, and Les Houches back to the Chamonix valley. This is a long, tiring descent of over 2,000\xa0m. Some climbers in the 1990s might have used the tram or cable car for part of the descent, but a full on-foot return caps a true ground-up ascent and descent of Mont Blanc.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Terrain Recap</h2>\\n<p>The terrain transitions from valley forest and meadows, to rocky moraine, alpine glacier, and finally snow and ice. Each zone presents its own challenges and beauty, from warm forests to glacial winds above 4,000 m. Total elevation gain and loss over three days is around 7,500\xa0m.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Common Hazards</h2>\\n<p>The Go\xfbter Route has serious dangers: rockfall in the Grand Couloir, altitude sickness, <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-glacier-fall-that-changed-everything/\\">glacier</a> crevasses, unpredictable weather, and crowd-related bottlenecks. While not a technically difficult climb, it requires experience, timing, and respect for conditions. The Grand Couloir was especially feared even in the 1990s due to frequent accidents and narrow crossing windows.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Key Bottleneck Points</h2>\\n<p>Key crowding or decision points included: Bellevue/Col de Voza (where hikers and tram riders separate), T\xeate Rousse vs. Go\xfbter Hut (overnight split), the Grand Couloir crossing, and the narrow Bosses Ridge. These areas often caused delays, stress, or risk, especially with large groups and mixed experience levels.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n<p>Completing the Go\xfbter Route from Chamonix on foot in three days was a significant alpine accomplishment, even more so in the busy, unregulated 1990s. It demanded strong fitness, steady nerves, and strategic choices. For those who summited and returned safely, it was an unforgettable journey from forests to the roof of Europe and back again — one step at a time.</p>\\n\\n<p>This experience was very different from the Greenland mountains I climbed solo - <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-day-we-saw-a-submarine-in-uummannaq/\\">Uummannaq</a> mountain, north side (behind it) 1190 meters, and Qilertinnguit (along the east ridge 2000 meters)</p>\\n","date":"2025-05-03","excerpt":"","category":"Sport & Hobbies","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/climbing-mt-blanc.png","imageAlt":"Climbing Mont Blanc (4,807 m summit) via the Go\xfbter Route","socialImage":null,"tags":["Sport & Hobbies","Greenland","Uummannaq","Journey"]},{"id":"0141ce44-40e0-4d13-83eb-547b34fda406","title":"The Gift That Disappeared - Gave away my Yamaha DX-7","slug":"the-gift-that-disappeared","content":"<p>In the winter light of <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-day-we-saw-a-submarine-in-uummannaq/\\">Uummannaq</a>, 1988, I gave away something that meant the world to me and sent it to the school of Uummannaq for the kids to play with. My <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_DX7\\">Yamaha DX-7</a> - a marvel of its time, shimmering with digital magic - was carefully packed and sent northward, a gift for the children of the town’s school. I imagined their curious fingers dancing across the keys, discovering sounds that could carry them beyond the icy mountains and into dreams. Music was my language, my gift, and I wanted to pass it on.</p>\\n\\n<p>The synth made it to the harbor. That much is certain. But from there, it vanished. Not stolen. Not broken. Just gone - absorbed into the silence of snow and cold storage. I searched. I asked. No one could explain where it went. Maybe they didn’t care enough to look.

I listened to those sounds - and there it was again: the voice of my youth, resurrected. I paid around $100, downloaded it, and without hesitation began re-recording old projects from my 80s archive — over 800 MIDI files I had kept like buried memories. That was late 2021. For the entirety of 2022, I lived inside those old songs, breathing life into them again.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then, in the shadow of all this creative rebirth, I suffered a <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/writing-music-after-a-stroke-my-journey-of-rediscovery/\\">massive stroke</a>. A <a href=\\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/symptoms-causes/syc-20350113\\">blood clot in the brain</a>. The song <em>We Need to Talk</em> — written just a week before it happened - could’ve been my last.</p>\\n\\n<p>But fate, ever unpredictable, gave me another chance. After 15 months of rehab, I returned - to the studio, to the DX-7 sounds, to the person I had nearly lost. I was slower, maybe softer, but still here.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Lost Synth</h2>\\n\\n<p>And still, I wonder about the original synth.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sometimes I dream of it. A dusty box in a forgotten warehouse, buried behind years of untouched pallets. Not stolen. Not thrown away. Just misplaced by time. It’s still there, I believe - unseen but intact, like part of my soul waiting to be rediscovered. Not that it matters now. The people who dismissed my gift, who questioned my story - they’re all gone. Their noise faded into silence.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Message</h2>\\n\\n<p>Maybe that’s what the universe was trying to tell me.</p>\\n\\n<p>Sometimes the music we give doesn’t land where we expect.<br>\\nSometimes it disappears — only to find its way back decades later, wearing a new face.<br>\\nSometimes <em>we</em> are the gift that disappears for a while … and returns.</p>\\n\\n<p>And sometimes, just sometimes, the silence gives birth to a new song.</p>","date":"2025-05-03","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/wchief/willsen-cdn@main/images/blog/missing-yamaha-dx-7.png","imageAlt":"The Gift That Disappeared","socialImage":null,"tags":["Music & Technology","Synth","Uummannaq","Stroke"]},{"id":"f213c7d3-63e5-457d-adf3-dc3f7a5389f8","title":"Would You Believe I\'m a Time Traveler?","slug":"would-you-believe-i-m-a-time-traveler","content":"<p>Let me ask you something impossible: What if every song you\'ve ever heard from me wasn\'t just music - but a transmission from another time?</p>\\n\\n    <p>I don\'t say this lightly.

In late May of 1979, when the sun never truly set and kids like us roamed the wild without a care, something happened that would stay with me forever.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Exploring the Mountain</h2>\\n\\n<p>That morning, a bunch of us were out exploring. We first tried to climb the south side of <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-gift-that-disappeared/\\">Uummannaq</a> Mountain - one of the oldest mountains in the world - but the rocks kept falling, too dangerous to continue. So we changed plans, deciding instead to explore the west side.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was a long walk, but with the bright sun overhead and fresh water from the lakes, we didn’t mind. We made our way past the first lake and up toward the “Blue Lake,” a higher, strikingly clear body of water nestled on the mountain\'s shoulder. From there, we crossed down and made our way toward the back of the mountain, deep into untouched terrain. Time passed quickly. By afternoon, we were still walking, marveling at the icy mountains and <a href=\\"https://willsen.dk/blog/the-black-angel-unveiling-the-toxic-legacy-of-lead-pollution-in-greenland/\\">Greenland\'s remote wilderness</a> stretching all the way to the distant horizon - an island 100 kilometers away. We used to joke that Canada lay just beyond that blue edge, and we\'d watch jets flying high above us, their contrails like scratches across the sky.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Shocking Discovery</h2>\\n\\n<p>As we sat down to rest, one of our friends who had wandered off to check for a bird\'s nest came rushing back - red-faced and breathless. He pointed urgently toward the northwest. We scrambled up about 100 meters - and there it was.</p>\\n\\n<p>A massive submarine, half-hidden behind an iceberg, silently resting in the deep blue water.</p>\\n\\n<p>At first, we thought it must be American. After all, who else could it be? But later, we learned the truth: it was a <a href=\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typhoon-class_submarine\\">Russian Typhoon-class submarine</a> - one of the largest submarines ever built. Even from a distance, it looked <em>huge</em> - almost unreal against the raw, wild backdrop of our Arctic home.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Reaction Back Home</h2>\\n\\n<p>We ran back to Uummannaq to tell everyone what we had seen, but few believed us. It was frustrating. Luckily, one of the ships that traveled between Uummannaq and the smaller settlements - the <em>Hvidfisken</em> - spotted it too. They even followed it briefly before it slipped away into the deep fjords.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Questions That Remain</h2>\\n\\n<p>Years later, I found out just how deep the waters are around Uummannaq - perfect for submarines to hide. It was clear: the Russians had been operating in our fjords.</p>\\n\\n<p>But one question has stayed with me ever since - why did it surface? The waters were busy with hunters and fishermen. This was no isolated spot. Did the submarine have technical problems? Was it waiting for something?</p>\\n\\n<p>We may never know.<br>\\nBut to a group of young kids on a late May day in 1979, it was an unforgettable brush with the Cold War - right in our own backyard.</p>\\n","date":"2025-04-25","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/typhoon-submarine-in-greenland.png","imageAlt":"The Day We Saw a Typhoon Submarine in Uummannaq","socialImage":null,"tags":["Music & Technology","Arctic","Greenland","Uummannaq"]},{"id":"722a7176-3adb-461e-b27c-ad1288fb49ae","title":"10 Influences That Shaped My Sound as a Greenlandic–Danish Rock Artist","slug":"10-influences-that-shaped-my-sound-as-a-greenlandic-danish-rock-artist","content":"<h2>1.

It was exciting, experimental, and honestly, a little wild.

We shook hands. He looked at me for a second and said, \\"You don\'t look Irish.\\"</p>\\n<p>I laughed and told him, \\"I\'m from Greenland.\\" That raised an eyebrow. I explained how Thin Lizzy had inspired me to pursue music more seriously, despite being so far from the world where rock legends lived and played.

It felt like talking to a kindred spirit, someone who understood the fire that music can ignite in a person.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Chilly Joke and a Heartwarming Moment</h2>\\n<p>He grinned and told me he had flown over Greenland before. \\"It looked too cold for me,\\" he joked. I laughed, saying, \\"Yeah, stone cold!\\" We both chuckled like two old friends sharing a private joke.</p>\\n<p>Before we parted ways, he told me, \\"Say hi to Greenland when you get home,\\" and wished me well. It was a short encounter, but it left a long-lasting imprint. John Sykes, one of my all-time guitar heroes - even though I’m a keyboard player - took a few minutes of his day to chat with a stranger. That meant the world to me.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Show and a Missed Pick</h2>\\n<p>That night at the concert, something magical happened. Somewhere between the soaring solos and the roaring crowd, he recognized me from earlier. He looked straight at me and threw a guitar pick in my direction. I reached... and missed it. But the gesture? Unforgettable.</p>\\n<p>Of course, this was long before we had phones in our pockets. Taking pictures wasn’t easy, and frankly, we weren’t thinking about photos - we were there to watch and listen, to live in the sound and soak in every note.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Still One of My Favorite Stories</h2>\\n<p>Even today, decades later, that brief meeting in Dublin remains one of my most cherished memories. Not just because I met a rock legend, but because it reminded me that music really does connect people - from the frostbitten coasts of Greenland to the electric streets of Dublin.</p>\\n<p>This song does have lots of inspiration from John Sykes - This song is dedicated to Ronnie Atkins, Pretty Maids, but has the distinct sound I learned from ear back then.</p>\\n<p>Another of my songs, Happy Birthday, is also very much inspired by John Sykes - I wish that I had been able to tell him about it.

He was in Nyborg to visit his girlfriend, who also happened to be a close friend of mine. Naturally, we had to mark the occasion with a proper celebration.</p>\\n<p>And by \\"proper celebration,\\" I mean: a bag full of beers, an impromptu plan, and a freight train bound for nowhere.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Waiting in the Cold</h2>\\n<p>We started out with good intentions. Just a quick hop to Odense, 30 kilometers away. Easy, right? The snow was thick, the temperature sat at a crisp -15\xb0C, and the station was practically deserted around 8 or 9 pm. But we weren’t bothered. The beer was cold (warmer than the air, oddly enough), and the thought of soon slipping into a warm train carriage kept us patient.</p>\\n<p>Except - no train came.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Brilliantly Bad Idea</h2>\\n<p>Back then, the bridge connecting Zealand and Funen hadn’t opened yet, so everything still depended on the ferries and old train schedules. As we debated heading back into town, a freight train rumbled in from the ferry, paused briefly at the station - likely coupling more wagons - and our frostbitten brains had a brilliant idea.</p>\\n<p>\\"Let’s hop it.\\"</p>\\n\\n<h2>Onboard and Freezing</h2>\\n<p>Now, don’t get me wrong - I grew up in the Arctic. I know how dangerous the cold is. Mats, though more of an urban survivalist, had guts. So we did it. Climbed on like a pair of half-drunk lunatics chasing warmth and adventure.</p>\\n<p>We found an open flat spot to sit on - still outside, mind you - and as soon as the train picked up speed, the cold hit like a punch. Our ‘cold’ beers were now warmer than the wind. We had to shout to hear each other. Mats had at least worn a long coat. I was in a short jacket and freezing fast.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Pee Dilemma</h2>\\n<p>Then I had to pee.</p>\\n<p>Now imagine trying to relieve yourself while hanging off a moving freight train in -15\xb0C. I passed my beer to Mats, grabbed onto a metal handle, and started… only to realize we were at the front of a wagon - not the back - so everything just... blew back into our faces.</p>\\n<p>Classic.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Not Slowing Down</h2>\\n<p>We laughed it off and figured we\'d be in Odense in no time - 15 minutes, tops. But the train didn’t slow down.</p>\\n<p>It didn’t slow down for the next town.<br>\\nOr the one after that.<br>\\nIt just kept going.</p>\\n<p>And that’s when worry set in. I remembered my father’s advice - never stand still in the cold. But here we were, glued to cold steel, unable to jump, and slowly freezing while sipping beers that only made the situation worse.</p>\\n<p>At some point, I whispered, “This thing’s going all the way to Germany.”</p>\\n\\n<h2>R\xf8dekro - Almost Germany</h2>\\n<p>It very nearly did.</p>\\n<p>After two and a half brutal hours, the train finally began to slow. We were just under 10 kilometers from the German border, in a little town called R\xf8dekro. When it stopped, we jumped off - frozen stiff, but still buzzing from adrenaline.</p>\\n<p>Naturally, we opened another beer to celebrate.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Dental Clinic</h2>\\n<p>The town was dead silent. Stores were shut. Streets empty. Panic started to creep in. We tried a few doors as we walked - nothing. Until one business door opened. A dental clinic, of all places. Someone had forgotten to lock it.</p>\\n<p>We looked at each other. No words needed. It was pure survival.</p>\\n<p>We didn’t go inside the clinic itself, just curled up by the stairwell at the entrance, finishing the last of our beers. Eventually, we passed out. When we woke up, our heads were pounding - not just from the alcohol, but from the fresh paint fumes. Apparently, the place had just been repainted.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Morning Salvation</h2>\\n<p>Dazed and fumy, we stumbled out into the cold morning and found Hotel R\xf8de-kro. Someone was prepping breakfast. Between the two of us, we scraped together just enough cash for two coffees and a slice of bread. We sat, warming up slowly, wondering how on earth we’d get back.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Back Without a Ticket</h2>\\n<p>Luckily, a train to Copenhagen was due.</p>\\n<p>Unluckily, we had no tickets.</p>\\n<p>Enter Mats, master of urban improvisation. As the conductor approached, he broke into fluent southern Swedish gibberish. When she turned to me, I joined in. Confused, she gave up and moved on. We rode all the way back to Odense in peace.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Afterparty</h2>\\n<p>Back in familiar territory, we met up with a friend who was ready to party - hard. And party we did. I honestly don’t remember much after that - just laughter, beer, and the kind of exhaustion only a 2.5-hour freight train freeze can gift you.</p>\\n\\n<p>But hey - Mats turned 30 in style.<br>\\nAnd we survived it. Barely.<br>\\nHappy Birthday, brother.</p>\\n<p>And the wildest part?<br>\\nMats will be 60 in just two years. Time flies - but that train sure didn’t.</p>","date":"2025-04-21","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/lars-mats1998-1.png","imageAlt":"Frozen Tracks and Freight Trains - Mats’s Wild 30th","socialImage":null,"tags":["Music & Technology","Arctic","Survival"]},{"id":"15433ae6-224c-4459-8dc4-ef0696b27cb6","title":"Creating After the Silence - How a Stroke Rewired My Music, My Mind, and My Mission","slug":"creating-after-the-silence-how-a-stroke-rewired-my-music-my-mind-and-my-mission","content":"<p>A little over 2 years ago, I was alone in my office when a massive stroke hit me. I couldn’t speak. I couldn’t move properly. For a while, I didn’t know if I would ever return to who I used to be. The doctors didn’t either. But somehow, the part of me that makes music survived.</p>\\n\\n<p>That changed everything.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Rewinding the Tape: A Life in Music and Code</h2>\\n\\n<p>Before the stroke, music had been a private universe. I’d written hundreds of songs over decades, starting in the 1980s. Many were lost to time or left unreleased. I was a synth player in hard rock bands. I coded by day, partied by night, and recorded in between.</p>\\n\\n<p>At one point, I lived the coder dream - we made $60k to $100k/month during the IT boom. And when that bubble burst, I slipped back into the shadows, keeping my music to myself.</p>\\n\\n<p>What most people never knew: I was quietly building an archive of deeply personal music, side projects no one ever heard, moments captured on tape or disk, still carrying the pulse of a wild life. That was the legacy I wanted to leave behind, especially for my daughter.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Sound After Silence</h2>\\n\\n<p>When I regained enough brain function to start working with sound again, I had to relearn how to play. I spent the next two years teaching myself how to mix, master, and re-record using the tools of a modern home studio. Every track is a sort of demo, a diary entry, a survival log.</p>\\n\\n<p>And now I release them.</p>\\n\\n<p>One of the works I’m most proud of is a double album reissue called \\"Whispers of the Northern Sky\\" - a collection of my 1980s-era synth compositions from two albums:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>\\"Dakota\\"</li>\\n  <li>\\"Val d\'sere\\"</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Both albums are re-recordings, but I kept all the little imperfections. No polishing. Just raw, honest sound. I turned them into a longform video that feels like a time capsule.</p>\\n\\n<p><iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/02shXhk4I1Q?si=XnUnXtTVTAIMP0tg\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>\\n\\n<p>Another release, \\"Last Flight from Arlanda,\\" is a 7-track story about my 10 years in Sweden - both the highs and the crashes. It\'s part memory, part documentary, full of party scene chaos and lonely coder hours.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then there are songs that still hit hard for me:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>\\"The Black Angel\\"</li>\\n  <li>\\"Do You Do I\\"</li>\\n  <li>\\"Springtime in Osaka\\" - which actually got radio play in Japan back in the \'90s, before the internet could even carry it across borders.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>There was even a Wikipedia page for me once. Someone else wrote it. But when I tried to fix a small mistake, a moderator removed the whole thing. That kind of invisibility has followed me most of my life.</p>\\n\\n<p>That makes it all the more surprising when people from my past discover what I’ve been doing now. They didn’t expect me to come back after a stroke. Most didn’t even know I had this much music in me. But I do. And I’m not done.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Why I’m Telling You This</h2>\\n\\n<p>I don’t have a label. I don’t have PR. I don’t even have much money. Around $50/month is what I live on after bills. But I have music. I have a story. And if you’re reading this, maybe you’ll see something of value in what I’m building.</p>\\n\\n<p>I’m not here asking for sympathy. I’m inviting people to witness something real: A man with damage in his brain but fire in his hands. A sound legacy being built while I still have time. Songs from the 1980s that never saw the light, now being reawakened in a very different world.</p>\\n\\n<p>If you want to support:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n  <li>Listen to my music</li>\\n  <li>Share it with someone who might connect</li>\\n  <li>Send a message</li>\\n  <li>Or support through PayPal or Bitcoin (links below)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Every little bit helps me keep documenting this strange and beautiful second act.</p>\\n\\n<h2>I survived to create.

I was just jumping down, something we kids did all the time on the glacier. But this time, I was wrong. Beneath the deceptive white was hard, slippery ice. I lost my footing and fell - fifteen feet down - slamming onto my back and head. I was knocked out cold.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Grey Days and a Silent Brain</h2>\\n<p>\\nFor an entire week, I was blind. Everything I saw was just grey. The doctors told us it was a severe concussion. Nobody knew what had really happened - not even me. A friend helped me get up and somehow brought me home. My dad took me to the hospital for an examination, but I don’t remember any of it. In fact, the next few years are mostly a blank.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Hidden Damage Revealed Years Later</h2>\\n<p>\\nIt wasn’t until I was in my 30s, during a CT scan, that a doctor casually mentioned I had once cracked my skull. Suddenly everything made sense. I’d always wondered why heading a football would make me dizzy when all the other boys could do it without a problem. I used to speculate about it, but instead of dwelling, I found new passions.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>From Blank Space to Arctic Creativity</h2>\\n<p>\\nThe long and dark Arctic winters offered their own kind of therapy. I dove into music with my friends, letting rhythms and melodies fill the empty spaces in my memory. I also picked up a strange new habit: making statistics of everything around me. It became an obsession of sorts. Then I discovered coding - starting with assembler. That saved me. It gave structure to a mind that had been shaken loose.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Mind That Changed</h2>\\n<p>\\nEven though nobody really talked about it, I knew something had changed in me after the fall. But it wasn’t until much later that I truly realized I was not like everyone else. I couldn’t explain it, and I still can’t fully. But I started having visions - moments where I could predict events before they happened. \\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>When the Future Became Familiar</h2>\\n<p>\\nAt first, I thought it was coincidence. But the more it happened, the harder it was to deny. I began telling friends about small things I felt would happen in a week or two. Some came true - too many, in fact. It started to scare them. Eventually, I stopped talking about it. \\n</p>\\n<p>\\nThe last time I ever mentioned a prediction was when I told my siblings, two weeks ahead, that George Michael would die. And then it happened. We all kept an eye on the news after that moment. It was real, and it was terrifying.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Stroke That Took Me Deeper</h2>\\n<p>\\nThen came the massive stroke - a new turning point. Whatever door the glacier fall had opened in my mind, the stroke kicked it wide open. Things started happening on a whole new level. I can\'t describe most of it, and I’ve long stopped trying to explain. Some people might think I’m crazy - maybe I am. But I know what I’ve felt, seen, and lived through.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Life Forever Tilted</h2>\\n<p>\\nThat fall, those fifteen feet, changed everything. It stole parts of me, but gave me other strange, indescribable gifts in return. I’ll never know what exactly happened in those moments I was unconscious, or what rewired in my brain. But one thing is certain: I’ve never been the same.\\n</p>\\n","date":"2025-04-02","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Technology","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/lars-willsen-glacier-fall.png","imageAlt":"The Glacier Fall That Changed Everything - Lars Willsen","socialImage":null,"tags":["Music & Technology","Arctic","Coding","Stroke"]},{"id":"7d27a70e-63cf-4d15-88d6-6785924f5c85","title":"Too Much Love: A Soundtrack for the Next American Psycho X","slug":"too-much-love-a-soundtrack-for-the-next-american-psycho-x","content":"<p>\\"Too Much Love\\" wasn’t written for a film. But it feels like it was made for one. Specifically, a sequel that doesn\'t exist—yet. Think <strong>American Psycho X</strong>. This time, with a woman at the center of it all. Cold. Controlled. Unapologetic.</p>\\n\\n<p>The track opens soft. \\"<em>Fly with me / Shine with me</em>\\" — an invitation, but it’s not clear where we’re going. The tone is seductive, detached. A luxury high-rise in Manhattan. Marble floors. The hum of a vintage stereo system. Think Phil Collins, but updated: sleeker, colder.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Luxury and Madness</h2>\\n\\n<p>In the universe of American Psycho, beauty hides blood. \\"Too Much Love\\" taps into that same paradox. The song drifts. Then flickers. It never settles. Each verse is like a different room in a pristine penthouse — minimal, spotless, hiding something beneath the surface.</p>\\n\\n<p>Verse one: \\"<em>Drifting slow / Fading / Waking</em>\\" — the slow unraveling. Verse two: \\"<em>Touch and go / Flicker / Whisper</em>\\" — moments of intimacy that never fully connect. By verse three, \\"<em>Close my eyes / Echo / Halo</em>\\" — we’re almost out of body. Floating above the violence we refuse to name.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Her World</h2>\\n\\n<p>Imagine the protagonist: a woman in her thirties. Polished. Powerful. She moves through the city like she owns it—because she kind of does. The track mirrors her perfectly. Not in a rush. Not showing emotion. Every sound is calculated. Stylish, but unsettling.</p>\\n\\n<p>The chorus — \\"<em>Wonders, for you / Too much, love</em>\\" — could be read as devotion. Or obsession. Or a threat. That’s the trick. It means all of them at once. That ambiguity is the core of both the film and the music.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Fade Out</h2>\\n\\n<p>The outro returns to where it began. \\"<em>Fly with me / Shine with me</em>\\" — but now it’s slower, fading out like the lights in a penthouse after something terrible just happened. It’s not over. But the night is.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"Too Much Love\\" doesn’t scream. It whispers. And in a world of curated chaos, that’s what makes it terrifying. It belongs in <em>American Psycho III</em> — not as a soundtrack filler, but as the mood-setter. The warning sign. The siren song playing as she walks away.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter Two: Show Me That You Love Me</h2>\\n\\n<p>The story continues with the second single, <strong>\\"Show Me That You Love Me\\"</strong> — a follow-up that digs deeper into the mind of our icy lead. Where the first track hinted, this one pushes. It\'s not about mystery anymore — it\'s about control.</p>\\n\\n<p>Set in the same lavish, sterile world of wealth and power, this track carries a sharper edge. The title isn’t a plea. It’s a test. A mirror held up to the listener. How far would you go to be seen, to be wanted — to be loved?</p>\\n\\n<p>Stylistically, the sound is even more stripped down. Cold synths. Deliberate pacing. Her voice — calm, but loaded. The tension is thick. Every beat calculated. You feel like you\'re watching something private that you shouldn’t be seeing.</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"Show Me That You Love Me\\" is the moment the audience realizes: she was never looking for love. She was looking for control. And now, she\'s got it.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter Three: Penthouse Baby (Postponed)</h2>\\n\\n<p>Enter <strong>\\"Penthouse Baby\\"</strong> — the third single in the <em>Salty White Substance</em> series. It\'s catchy, sleek, and burns with understated menace. This time, the high-rise isn\'t just her habitat. It\'s her hunting ground.</p>\\n\\n<p>Glossy surfaces, velvet ropes, whispered deals — the imagery of Manhattan\'s elite comes alive in the beat. She\'s moving through it all: untouchable, lethal, and fully aware of her power. \\"Penthouse Baby\\" is a celebration of dominance wrapped in silk and champagne bubbles. It\'s not just a place. It\'s her throne.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Chapter Four: Trading These Wounds</h2>\\n\\n<p>The unraveling takes center stage with the fourth single, <strong>\\"Trading These Wounds\\"</strong>. If the previous tracks painted her as icy and calculated, this one shows the cracks — not weaknesses, but choices made with open eyes.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>\\"Trading These Wounds\\"</em> could absolutely be the sonic thread of a modern-day <em>American Psycho</em>. It’s not about sanity—it’s about the beautiful disintegration of it. The verses drift through fear and color, through the act of holding on and letting go:</p>\\n\\n<p>\\"<em>Looking through fear... oh, hold it back / So much color... needed now</em>\\" — she\'s seeing it all, but choosing when to react. The bridge hits sharp with \\"<em>Hollow / Sorrow / User</em>,\\" pulling us into her emotional void.</p>\\n\\n<p>The chorus hits like a defiant laugh in a silent room: \\"<em>Trading these wounds, bye… ha ha ha / Breaking these chains, fly… ha ha ha</em>\\" — manic, liberating, and a little terrifying. It’s the sound of a final break from any kind of humanity that once tethered her.</p>\\n\\n<p><em>Trading These Wounds</em> is the fourth piece of a collapsing empire, but it’s all intentional. She\'s not falling apart. She\'s evolving into something new — something even more dangerous.</p>","date":"2025-03-26","excerpt":"","category":"Music & Movies","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/too-muc-love1920x1080 copy.jpg","imageAlt":"Too Much Love: A Soundtrack for the Next American Psycho","socialImage":null,"tags":["Music & Movies","Synth"]},{"id":"26ef5d17-5030-421f-8c8e-c9ec25f57efd","title":"Serotonin Bloom: A Soundtrack of My Inner World","slug":"serotonin-bloom-a-soundtrack-of-my-inner-world","content":"<p>\\n  \\"Serotonin Bloom\\" is more than just an album - it\'s a personal journey told through 19 instrumental synth tracks, each carrying a piece of my life, memory, or vision. These compositions, largely unheard before their release, are part of my ongoing \\"demo tapes” project - an effort to share decades of private music, written in solitude and silence, with the world.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Long Time Ago in the Future</h2>\\n<p>\\n  Several of the tracks on this album were born during train rides between Nyborg and Horsens, back when I was commuting during rehearsal periods. The rhythm of the train and the blurred Danish landscape provided the perfect atmosphere to capture the feeling of distant futures rooted in old memories. This track is dedicated to Ken Hammer from Pretty Maids.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>CPH Gate 58, Copenhagen Airport</h2>\\n<p>\\n  This track comes from a vision I had long before my daughter was born - a vision of her leaving early in life, just like I did. Years later, that vision became real when she courageously traveled to South Korea all on her own. The piece is filled with emotion, longing, pride, and the cyclical nature of life.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>I\'ll Be Your Angel</h2>\\n<p>\\n  This one is hauntingly prophetic. I saw the shadow of my massive stroke a year before it happened. Driven by that vision, I felt a deep urgency to record my youth in music - to capture the essence of who I was before my body betrayed me. This track is a dedication to the guardian angel I needed and perhaps became through my music.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>Morud</h2>\\n<p>\\n  A gentle, easy listening piece dedicated to the peaceful village of Morud - where my wife grew up and where we now live. It\'s surrounded by forests and quietude, and this track reflects the serenity and stability I’ve found here after years of personal turbulence.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>El Capitan</h2>\\n<p>\\n  I’ve always been fascinated by mountains. Having climbed Mont Blanc and local giants like the mountain of Uummannaq and Qilertinnguit in Greenland, I’ve developed a spiritual connection with high places. \\"El Capitan\\" is a tribute to those towering symbols of strength and perseverance.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Demo Tapes Project</h2>\\n<p>\\n  All my releases - including \\"Serotonin Bloom\\" - should be seen as part of my demo tapes project. After writing over 800 songs and re-recording more than 200 before my stroke, I’ve been able to release them with just a slight polish. These are not just tracks - they\'re memories, warnings, hopes, and thanks.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Gift to Humanity</h2>\\n<p>\\n  This album is my way of giving back to the human race. I\'ve spent a life navigating hardship, often alone, and music has always been my way of processing those emotions. Through these instrumental synth pieces, I invite listeners to feel the world as I did - to walk through my visions, memories, and truths.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p><div style=\\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRmTm2lWqJU?si=j47uePz4A7MDTaRE\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" \\n    referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" \\n    allowfullscreen \\n    style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\">\\n  </iframe>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<h2>Listen and Reflect</h2>\\n<p>\\n  Take a moment to sit with this album.

The key is not to let it break you. Then came COVID. I thought, \\"Okay, I\'m done. I\'m old, I\'ll just sit around and wait to die.\\" But then I stopped myself. \\"Wait a minute, that\'s not me.\\"</p>\\n\\n<p>I\'ve been through it all - drugs, danger, and the kind of insane shit that most people wouldn\'t even attempt. I climbed Mont Blanc, climbed my local mountain from the north side with nothing but water, two Yankie bars, and a torch lamp. In case I needed to signal anyone… not that I had a chance in hell of getting anyone\'s attention from up there.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then there were the 30+ years where I never played a single note. I tell myself, well… at least I didn\'t have to deal with more primadonnas and fake people. Maybe it was a blessing in disguise not getting \\"famous.\\" People told me I had the talent, the looks, and the insanity to pull it off. But hey, I accepted my fate.</p>\\n\\n<p>I had a vision, and I knew a stroke was coming. That\'s why I started re-recording all my old shit - to document <strong>me</strong>, the real me, and no one else. Everything you hear on streaming services? I kept it a secret. They were side-projects. Lucky for me, MIDI existed back then, so I saved my music onto floppy disks - some with lyrics, others with bits of sound. No regrets.</p>\\n\\n<p>I spent time in mental hospitals a few times. They locked the doors, had guards watching my every move. I even tried electrocuting myself using the lamp cables while holding the tap. But it\'s Denmark… you can\'t electrocute yourself. They\'ve got fuses and safety systems in place to make sure no one checks out that way.</p>\\n\\n<p>The parties were insane. When I was coding, I made between 60-100K a month. We worked three weeks, then partied one. And every damn month, the money was gone - drugs, booze, and fast women. So no, I\'m no angel.

Unlike the stereotypical ambient tracks commonly heard on streaming platforms, his compositions weave deep narratives, emotional depth, and cinematic textures into extended soundscapes. His works span relaxation, meditation, and immersive storytelling, with tracks lasting from 15 minutes up to an hour.</p>\\n\\n<p>A prime example of this is his 6 - hour - long album, <i>Nexos (Selected Ambient Tracks Volume I)</i>, available on <a href=\\"https://open.spotify.com/album/2b7vxx4V57mLqR7tPlMkbV?si=ESwv8Ic7RGCg-2SNiWn0Yg\\">Spotify</a>, Apple Music, Amazon, and all major streaming platforms. This 15 - track collection showcases Willsen\'s ability to create long - form ambient experiences that are unlike anything else in the genre.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Nexos (Selected Ambient Tracks Volume I) - An Expansive Sonic Journey</h2>\\n\\n<p>Each track on <i>Nexos</i> tells a story, whether it\'s a reflection on personal experiences, a sonic exploration of the unknown, or a deep dive into meditative states. Some of the most notable tracks include:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><b>\\"Void\\"</b> - A piece that has gained notable popularity, likely because it resonates deeply with those who discover it. A drifting, weightless journey into the vastness of nothingness.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"B - 2 Detector\\"</b> - A sonic representation of flight, inspired by the experience of moving through the air and the stealth and mystery of the legendary aircraft.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"Stroke\\"</b> and <b>\\"Coma\\"</b> - Deeply personal compositions reflecting Willsen\'s own experiences with a stroke and the altered states of consciousness that followed.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"Unknown Species\\"</b> - A 33 - minute odyssey into the unknown, a journey beyond human understanding into new sonic territories.</li>\\n<li><b>\\"I Am DB Cooper\\"</b> - A cryptic and mysterious track inspired by one of history\'s greatest aviation mysteries.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>Each composition is crafted to be more than just background noise - it is an evolving, dynamic piece of art meant to be experienced in full.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Sound Beyond the Stereotypical Ambient Genre</h2>\\n\\n<p>Many ambient artists follow predictable patterns, but Willsen\'s music defies convention. His ambient tracks incorporate cinematic structures, unique tonal shifts, and an emotional depth that stands apart from the generic loops and drones that dominate the genre. His work does not conform to the commercial expectations of relaxation music - it is immersive, thought - provoking, and deeply atmospheric.</p>\\n\\n<p>For those seeking ambient music with substance, emotion, and storytelling, Lars Willsen\'s long - form ambient tracks are a must - listen.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Listen to Lars Willsen\'s Ambient Works</h2>\\n\\n<p>Many of these tracks can also be found on Lars Willsen\'s official YouTube channel: <a href=\\"https://www.youtube.com/@larswillsen/videos\\">Lars Willsen YouTube</a>.

One such moment for me took place in the mid-70s, aboard a Sikorsky S-61 helicopter flying over the remote wilderness of Greenland.</p>\\n\\n<p>We were returning home after spending a long summer in Denmark. My mother and two siblings had stayed behind and would follow later. Back then, travel between Greenlandic cities was often by helicopter, and this flight was no different. Departing from Kangerlussuaq (S\xf8ndre Str\xf8m), we were set to land in several towns along the way to drop off passengers and refuel. The helicopter was packed - fifteen passengers, plus two pilots and a mechanic. The front right seats had been removed to accommodate a large amount of mail. Among the passengers was my father’s cousin.</p>\\n\\n<p>Flying in Greenland is always unpredictable, but nothing could have prepared us for the storm we encountered that day. It struck without warning as we reached the Nuussuaq Peninsula, north of Disko Island. The Swedish pilots were known to be some of the best - hardcore professionals who had faced all manner of challenges. But even they struggled against the extreme winds. The helicopter was tossed around like a toy, fighting to maintain control. I wasn’t scared, not yet - my father sat beside me, looking completely calm despite the chaos unfolding around us. That calmness reassured me, even as we were slammed against our seatbelts.</p>\\n\\n<p>Then came the sounds - loud bangs like metal breaking apart, followed by an eerie screaming noise, as if something was being torn open. I turned to my father, searching his face for any sign of concern. He remained composed, but around us, passengers were beginning to panic. The pilots were locked in a desperate struggle against the storm, doing everything they could to regain stability.</p>\\n\\n<p>Suddenly, the helicopter began an unnatural slow spin. Something was terribly wrong. We descended rapidly, plummeting toward the landscape below. Then, with a bone-jarring impact, we crashed onto a sand basin nestled between towering mountains. The pilots wasted no time - engines were shut off immediately. The mechanic threw open the door and leapt out, followed by the rest of us, stumbling onto the cold, barren ground.</p>\\n\\n<p>It was my father’s cousin who first spotted it - the reason we were still alive. He pointed to the tail rudder shaft. The metal casing had been ripped wide open. The tail rotor - critical for stability - had nearly been sheared off. Just a few more inches, and we would have been sent into an uncontrollable spin, plummeting to certain death. The realization hit everyone at once. We had come within moments of disaster.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Strangers in the Storm</h2>\\n\\n<p>But then, something even stranger happened.</p>\\n\\n<p>We were stranded in the middle of nowhere, deep in an uninhabited stretch of Greenland. No settlements, no people - only mountains and the howling storm. And yet, someone was watching us.</p>\\n\\n<p><div style=\\"position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; height: auto;\\">\\n  <iframe \\n    src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3FTOxmzAp3s?si=tHHuphgxIkCGwGrR\\" \\n    title=\\"YouTube video player\\" \\n    frameborder=\\"0\\" \\n    allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" \\n    referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" \\n    allowfullscreen \\n    style=\\"position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;\\">\\n  </iframe>\\n</div></p>\\n\\n<h2>Aftermath</h2>\\n\\n<p>The storm raged on. The pilots finally established radio contact, and hours later, another helicopter arrived to rescue us. We were flown to safety, but the encounter was never truly explained. Over the years, it was rarely spoken of - only mentioned in hushed conversations, with theories ranging from divine intervention to spirits of the land watching over us.</p>\\n\\n<p>To this day, I don’t know what I saw. But I know what I experienced. And that experience shaped me - after that day, there was little left in the world that could truly scare me.</p>\\n\\n<p>My song <em>Crash</em> is an instrumental piece inspired by that event. A memory of a near-fatal descent and the presence of something beyond explanation, standing in the storm, watching us from the shadows.</p>","date":"2025-03-11","excerpt":"","category":"Personal","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/chopper.png","imageAlt":"","socialImage":null,"tags":["Personal","Greenland"]},{"id":"957e9167-eb5c-4adc-ac3d-314441b22713","title":"Rootless: A Lost Album Reclaimed","slug":"rootless-a-lost-album-reclaimed","content":"<h2>The Long Road to Release</h2>\\n\\n<p>Some albums take years to make, others take decades to see the light of day. <em>Rootless</em> is one of those records that fell into the void of \'what could have been\' - until now. Originally recorded in 1989 and meant to be my first major release, it was buried due to an altercation with the label CEO in a Cardiff bar. Let\'s just say I wasn’t about to be pushed into the background as just \\"the synth player\\" in my own band.

On May 8th, 2024, <em>Rootless</em> finally got the release it deserved.

The truth is, I never showed up. I never collected the diploma, never stood in line with my classmates to mark the end of that chapter. While they celebrated, I was in a basement rehearsal room, writing a song called <em>Strong</em> - a song that I will finally release soon. When you hear it, you\'ll know exactly what was going through my mind that day.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Different Path</h2>\\n\\n<p>Most students went home that day, some traveling far away to their families. But somehow, I didn’t feel like I belonged there. It’s incredible to think about now, looking back more than 40 years later. Still, I did great afterward in a different way - through coding. I was lucky that I learned to program in assembly as a kid, and I can confidently say that skill alone shaped a huge part of my life. Later, I earned certifications from Stockholm University in computer science, mastering math-crunching like it was second nature. That was one of the reasons why the Swedish military took an interest in me.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Success and Excess</h2>\\n\\n<p>I lived most of my life alone. I wrote a million songs. Life was never easy for me. I was sent more than 3,000 miles away from home to attend school in Europe when I was very young. I was ripped away from my friends, from my roots. Looking back, sometimes I wish I had just stayed and lived a simple life. But fate had different plans.</p>\\n\\n<p>By the 90s, I was earning more than many top CEOs. And I partied just as hard. Sometimes I woke up in mental hospitals - not because I was mentally ill, but because of the extreme consequences of substance abuse. I saw it all, lived it all, and in the end, I found my wife. Since then, I have never partied like that again.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\\n\\n<p>Do I have regrets? No. But I did learn one thing: never give a second chance to those who did you wrong. I learned that early on, and it kept me on a path where nobody could touch me. Nobody can truly say they know me. Maybe one or two people have an idea, but the rest? They have no clue.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Life on the Move</h2>\\n\\n<p>As I mentioned, I worked in the Swedish military, and they gave me a cover job at a civilian IT company. That life took me all over - Lule\xe5, Uppsala, Stockholm, Kalmar, Malm\xf6, and places I barely remember. I lived in hotels as if they were home. My expenses were pre-paid, and somehow, I always managed to convince the bartenders to send bottles up to my room to knock me out after long and stressful coding sessions. I was so efficient that they let me do whatever I wanted. I have many stories - things most people will never experience. But I lived them all.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Looking Back</h2>\\n\\n<p>And now, here I am, sitting with a brain damaged from a recent stroke, reflecting on the life I’ve lived. Despite everything, I have a beautiful daughter. In the end, I really can’t ask for more.</p>\\n\\n<p>Greenland had no job opportunities for me - those levels in coding didn’t even exist, and they still don’t, as most IT work is outsourced to Danish companies. All of us who were sent to Denmark were misled by a school system run by Denmark. We were shuffled from school to school without any real purpose other than to graduate, only to end up working as ‘slaves’ for the administration back home. Banks and the government made it nearly impossible to start a business.</p>\\n\\n<p>So, instead, I traveled the world and learned a lot along the way. I have coded across most of Europe and North America and was even hired by major players when the Internet arrived in Denmark - almost two years after Sweden. At the time, there were the usual millionaires scrambling to claim the biggest share, some of them quite famous in Denmark. I won’t mention names, but a few of them still owe me a significant amount of money.</p>","date":"2025-03-08","excerpt":"","category":"Personal Life","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/synthfreak_The_Day_I_Chose_Music_Over_Graduation_a_dark_long__2537e379-5eab-49b8-accf-2dfbad201c82_2-2.png","imageAlt":"","socialImage":null,"tags":["Personal Life","Greenland","Coding","Stroke"]},{"id":"90eeb0d8-5830-4bb0-a4d2-0dcdc1d06a88","title":"Writing Music After a Stroke: My Journey of Rediscovery","slug":"writing-music-after-a-stroke-my-journey-of-rediscovery","content":"<h2>Lost Chords and a New Reality</h2>\\n<p>Imagine listening to a track you once knew inside out, but now, you can’t connect three chords in rapid succession. You “see” the chords somewhere in your mind, but they slip away before you can string them together. That’s been my reality since a blood clot hit the left side of my brain. The doctors couldn’t dissolve it - it was too late. Yet, amidst the challenges, something unexpected happened: my tinnitus disappeared, and for the first time in decades, I could smell food while watching cooking videos.</p>\\n\\n<p>This newfound sensory clarity came with an odd side effect: I began to smell chords and see their colors in real-time. It’s as if my brain is compensating for what was lost, amplifying other senses to make up for the gaps.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Music and a Secret Past</h2>\\n<p>But back to music - my lifeline. In the mid-\'80s, I was a beta tester for Cubase, and I was good at it. Music was my world until an unfortunate event rendered my fingers unable to play keyboards. In response, I buried myself in my other passion: assembly coding. I coded for the Swedish military under a cover job that silenced my story for over 30 years. Not even my closest friends knew the truth. Music disappeared from my life entirely.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Chance Encounter</h2>\\n<p>Fast forward to 2021, when fate nudged me back. A chance encounter with someone who needed help with a music video reignited a dormant spark. I offered to help and ended up adding Hammond B3 organ parts using GarageBand. For the first time in over three decades, I touched a musical instrument. That small act snowballed into something life-changing. My wife and daughter gifted me a home studio for my 60th birthday, and I began re-recording thousands of tracks stored on ancient Atari floppy disks from my Cubase days.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Relearning Everything</h2>\\n<p>I had to relearn everything: how to use a DAW, play an instrument, and navigate the intricacies of modern music production - compression, EQ, effects, and more. By the end of 2022, I was making progress. And then, on December 18th, 2022, a massive stroke hit. Game over.</p>\\n\\n<p>Or so I thought.</p>\\n\\n<h2>The Road to Recovery</h2>\\n<p>The recovery was grueling - 15 months of physiotherapy, relearning basic skills, and piecing my life back together with my wife fighting for me every step of the way. By the end of 2024, I found myself slowly building a new reality. Disability pension granted me some security, and though life is slower now, I’ve returned to making music, even releasing several tracks.</p>\\n\\n<p>It’s a lonely road. I’ve disconnected from social media, relying solely on YouTube to share my work. I haven’t seen or spoken to friends since the stroke, and my brain damage requires 10–12 hours of sleep nightly. Time flies, and I’m fighting harder than anyone can imagine - physically, emotionally, and creatively.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\\n<p>Music has become both a challenge and a salvation.

This track revisits the dark legacy of the Black Angel lead-zinc mine in Maarmorilik, which operated from 1973 to 1990, leaving a trail of pollution and health risks that continue to affect the local community.</p>\\n\\n    <p>For those of us who grew up in the region, the mine wasn’t just a distant operation - it was part of our landscape, our reality. The fjord, once pristine, was tainted by the relentless pursuit of profit. The long-term effects of lead exposure are only now fully coming to light, as the people who called this place home struggle with health complications linked to that era.</p>\\n\\n    <p>The name <strong>\\"The Black Angel\\"</strong> isn\'t just symbolic; it carries the weight of corporate greed and environmental neglect. Lead poisoning is a silent destroyer, and the track serves as a stark reminder of the cost of unchecked industrial activity. It’s a story that needs to be told, and sometimes, the most powerful way to tell it is through music.</p>\\n\\n    <p>This song isn’t just about looking back - it’s about raising awareness. The agenda behind these operations is clear: depopulation of small settlements to make way for large-scale resource extraction. The pattern repeats, and those in power continue to ignore the real consequences, while local pseudo-activists and academics from the south enable the status quo instead of fighting for real change.</p>\\n\\n    <h2>Musical Elements</h2>\\n\\n    <p>Musically, <strong>\\"The Black Angel\\"</strong> is built on deep, resonant tones that echo the weight of its message.

They traveled from what is now Russia - crossing the Bering Strait - onward to Alaska, and eventually, some of them, including my own lineage, made their way to Greenland. This long, perilous migration inspires much of the imagery behind the melody, transforming it into a cinematic dreamscape that speaks of survival, triumph, and the human spirit.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Origins of the Composition</h2>\\n<p>The melody for \\"I am Nomad\\" was first created during a time when I could still play the piano with ease. Unfortunately, I lost much of my piano-playing ability after a parasitic infection in the late 1980s, which coincidentally happened around the time I was auditioning for the band Pretty Maids. Despite the setback, I continued my musical journey using different tools. Recently, I turned to EZkeys 2 software to help replicate the chords and voicings of the original piece, ensuring I could capture the song’s essence just as I had first conceived it.</p>\\n\\n<h2>A Tribute to Inuit Resilience</h2>\\n<p>The main theme of \\"I am Nomad\\" is the resilience and courage of the Inuit who made that treacherous journey millennia ago. It is no small feat to survive and thrive in such harsh environments. My ancestors, as some family stories go, joined a later migration that reached Greenland around 500-1,000 years ago, while others arrived approximately 1,000 years earlier from Canada. In my dreams, I often relive the dangers of those times. There is an inexplicable familiarity with places I have never physically visited, and I sometimes wonder if these memories are preserved in our genes or carried on frequencies beyond our understanding.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Embracing Fears - and the Bears</h2>\\n<p>A recurring element in these dreams is the presence of bears. I have always had a deep-seated fear of them, yet I once found myself on a bear hunt in Alaska without any intention to kill. Strangely enough, the bears seemed to sense this - they left us alone, almost as if they understood we meant them no harm. This idea of mutual respect and connection with nature also weaves its way into the music of \\"I am Nomad,\\" especially through the use of the Inuit drum and the inclusion of original vocal techniques reminiscent of our traditional songs.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Instrumentation and Collaboration</h2>\\n<p>Originally, the melody was played solely on the piano. However, after losing my childhood friend and renowned musician Peter Leibhardt, I felt drawn to replace certain piano lines with an acoustic guitar. This decision was both emotional and practical - the piano parts were already quite demanding, and the guitar lent a warm, human touch that felt right for honoring Peter’s memory. Additionally, I used strings from Crow Hill companies\' \\"The Vault\\" series to create the layered, atmospheric backdrop. Together, the drum, acoustic guitar, and carefully arranged orchestration aim to paint a sonic picture of our ancestors’ journey and the fragile beauty of the Arctic landscapes they crossed.</p>\\n\\n<h2>From Music to Coding - A Life in Two Worlds</h2>\\n<p>Following my abrupt departure from the music scene due to my hand injury, I transitioned into a career as a hardcore coder. My work spanned a range of fields and even involved projects for the Swedish military, among other organizations worldwide. Yet, music never truly left my heart. Now at 62, revisiting \\"I am Nomad\\" feels like stepping back into a part of myself that was left behind but never lost.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Reflections on the Journey</h2>\\n<p>Today, as I continue to dream of distant tundras, formidable mountain passes, and the sounds of wolves echoing across frozen landscapes, I feel more certain than ever that \\"I am Nomad\\" is more than just a song. It is a musical time capsule that carries the spirit of our Arctic odyssey, the persistent will of our ancestors, and the profound mystery of cultural memory. Whether you are Inuit or from a completely different background, I hope that listening to \\"I am Nomad\\" offers a momentary glimpse into the grandeur, danger, and triumph that shaped not only my forebears but also the person I have become. After decades spent apart from piano, it has been a true blessing to revisit this composition and share a piece of our rich, enduring legacy.</p>\\n\\n<p>This song is dedicated to my childhood friend, Anders Samuelsen, whom we sadly lost to the sea in a boat accident - loved and never forgotten.</p>\\n","date":"2025-02-27","excerpt":"","category":"Songs","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/i-am-nomad-inuit-lars-willsen.png","imageAlt":"I am Nomad, a song about my Inuit ancestors and their long journey crossing the land bridge and all the way to Greenland","socialImage":null,"tags":["Songs","Inuit Heritage","Musician","Inuit","Greenland","Arctic","Software","Coding","Heritage","Journey","Legacy","Survival","Triumph","Resilience"]},{"id":"silent-strings-eternal-legacy","title":"Silent Strings Eternal Legacy - A Journey of Music and Code","slug":"silent-strings-eternal-legacy-a-journey-of-music-and-code","content":"<p>In the vibrant music scene of the 1980s, I was known as a hardrocker, sharing the stage and studio with numerous musicians who would go on to become legends. Yet, there was another side to my life, one that few knew about. While my friends and bandmates saw me as a musician, I was also deeply immersed in the world of coding, a craft I had mastered at a time when it was still a mysterious art. My expertise in 8088 and x86 processors made me a sought-after freelance coder, with companies and even the Swedish military seeking my skills to transform bulky code into efficient, compact masterpieces.</p>\\n<h2>The Dual Life of a Coder-Musician</h2>\\n<p>The 1980s were a whirlwind of music and coding. By day, I was a \\"normal\\" guy, hanging out with friends, jamming with my band, and living what seemed to be a regular life. But at night, I would retreat into the world of assembly language, crafting game engines, optimizing military software, and even dabbling in early neural networks for AI. The cover job provided by the military allowed me to delve into multimedia projects, simulating civilian infrastructure, and creating learning programs, all under the guise of a public role.</p>\\n<p>Most of my friends, especially those in Sweden, were unaware of my coding endeavors. They saw me as a multimedia enthusiast, a perception that suited me fine. It allowed me to keep my two worlds separate, even from those closest to me. This secretive life extended to my relationships; not even my girlfriends knew what I was truly working on. While the world around me was evolving, I was constantly creating, both in the realm of code and music.</p>\\n<h2>A Musician\'s Struggle and Triumph</h2>\\n<p>Throughout this period, I continued to write and produce music, pouring my soul into over 800 tracks, many of which were saved as MIDI files with accompanying lyrics. However, the bands I played with often lacked the drive I had, resulting in frustration and unmet potential. Despite the challenges, I released an album titled <em>Rootless</em>, though it never gained the distribution it deserved.</p>\\n<p>The music industry was tough, filled with prima donnas who refused to play small venues and vocalists who couldn’t write lyrics, much less speak English fluently. These obstacles led to multiple rejections from record labels, even when they initially expressed interest in our material. My passion for music was met with skepticism, both from those within the industry and from former friends who couldn’t understand how I could produce so much music so quickly.</p>\\n<h2>The Silent Saboteur</h2>\\n<p>One of the most disheartening discoveries came much later. As I released more of my music in recent years, I noticed a pattern - one of my late friends consistently disliked my tracks. This hurt, especially because I had dedicated an album to him before he passed. After his death, the dislikes stopped, confirming my suspicions. It was a painful realization that someone I had considered a friend was actively working against me, yet it didn’t deter me. I knew that my music wasn’t just for public acclaim; it was a legacy I wanted to leave for my daughter, Freya.</p>\\n<h2>Legacy of Code and Melody</h2>\\n<p>The parasitic infection that struck in the early 1990s ended my music career prematurely, rendering my fingers unable to play for over 30 years. During this time, I focused on my coding career, working with companies worldwide and contributing to projects that ranged from video games to military systems. But my love for music never faded. After recovering some use of my hands, I re-recorded the tracks from <em>Rootless</em> and released them, fulfilling a promise to myself and my daughter.</p>\\n<p>My story is one of resilience, of balancing a double life that few knew about, and of creating a legacy that will endure long after I’m gone. Despite the setbacks, the betrayals, and the physical challenges, I’ve succeeded in what matters most: leaving behind a body of work that speaks to my passion, both in music and in code. Today, as I reflect on my journey, I know that I did it all for Freya, and that is enough.</p>\\n","date":"2024-02-20","excerpt":"In the vibrant music scene of the 1980s, I was known as a hardrocker, sharing the stage and studio with numerous musicians who would go on to become l...","category":"Personal Story","author":"Lars Willsen","published":true,"image":"uploads/blog/lars-willsen-1988.png","imageAlt":"Lars Willsen in 1988","socialImage":null,"tags":["Personal Story","Musician","Coding","Software","Legacy","Journey","Triumph","Resilience"]},{"id":"pretty-maids-audition","title":"Pretty Maids Audition - A Story of Persistence","slug":"pretty-maids-audition-a-story-of-persistence","content":"<h2>The Hospital and the Call</h2>\\n<p>In the late \'90s, I was at Nyborg hospital with swollen fingers. The doctors couldn\'t figure out why (it was later discovered to be a parasitic infection, possibly from one of my many trips to exotic parts of the world). While I was at the hospital, a nurse came and told me that someone had called, said it was important, and would call again in a quarter of an hour. The nurse brought the phone in (we didn\'t have mobile phones back then) and plugged it in. I waited for a moment before it rang. I answered the phone, and on the other end was Ken Hammer, whom I knew through Rick Hanson, with whom I had played before. During our many trips to Aarhus, where Rick lived, we often stopped by Horsens to visit Ken. We had many mutual acquaintances, but I was surprised why he was calling me while I was in the hospital; it must have been important... and it was, at least in my world. Ken asked directly, \\"How\'s it going?\\" ... \\"Hey, Lars... do you want to play with us? Allan has dropped out, and we need a keyboard player...\\" I asked, \\"When?\\" ... Ken replied, \\"Yeah, tomorrow?\\" Haha... I said I could do it once I was discharged from the hospital, and that was fine. I discharged myself to go home and go through the songs that I already knew. I had played all their songs under various circumstances, and also because I played with Rick Hanson, it was obvious to play \'Red hot &amp; heavy\' with Hammond organ. Interestingly, it was at a time when I was coding for a host of foreign companies and, on the side, writing my music (which was never recorded, but I\'ve refreshed many of them here in 2022-24). When I was ready and had rehearsed all their songs (the ones with synths, because not all have synths), I went to Horsens.</p>\\n<h2>The Attack at the train station in Horsens</h2>\\n<p>When I arrived at Horsens train station, I was attacked in the station tunnel between the platforms by two drunks, a big guy and a small annoying sidekick. He kicked out at me and called me a junkie, but I deflected the kick, dropped my keyboard, which lost a key so that it was only half attached. I then kicked the big guy right between the legs as hard as I could, sure that I busted his balls. He fell directly to the ground, clutching his balls. The little one tried again, acting like a rabid fox terrier. I blocked one of his punches and threw a punch to his throat. It was meant to go up into his nose, but he was drunk and ducked down, so I ended up hitting his throat so hard that he too was out of the picture. I grabbed my keyboard and ran up the stairs, and near the exit, I ran into an empty DSB restaurant on the right side. There was a waitress who was startled by my entrance. I quickly told her that I had been attacked and that they were probably after me. She quickly guided me behind a partition. She said that the two guys had stormed past and out into the square and that I should just stay where I was. She asked if she should call the police, but I said no because I had an audition with Pretty Maids. She looked at me, and she knew who Pretty Maids were. When the two idiots were gone, she offered to let me use their phone. I called Ken Hammer and explained that I had been attacked and was a little late. It didn\'t matter much because I was supposed to go to his apartment, and from there, we were to drive to the rehearsal room in the city.</p>\\n<h2>Preparation and Audition</h2>\\n<p>I knew all their songs since a friend introduced me to them many years earlier at Gertrud Rask\'s dormitory in Odense (he had the first album with the demons and also \'Red Hot &amp; Heavy,\' which was significantly better than the first). I think the reason they called me was that Rick Hanson had vouched for me - I played with Rick up until that time in Nyborg along with the later drummer Mike Fast, so I think Michael had also mentioned me, but it was before his time with them. I had refreshed their songs the day before, and it went okay, though I couldn\'t hear myself. As mentioned, I knew their songs well enough to play them in my sleep. When I was there, they had just recorded \'Jump the Gun\' (\'Lethal Heroes\' in the USA). The second time I went up there, I recorded the intro to \'Lethal Heroes\' on my Atari using only the JX-3P... even though the sounds weren\'t quite the same, Zumme (Paul aka. Ronnie Atkins) liked it. He listened from the hallway and came in, seemingly surprised that I had taken the time to do it, given that it was only an audition... But they called me back again; they probably had a lot of people trying out during that time. I was called in a couple more times, and during that period, Ken had moved out to a large house on Koralvej in Horsens, where I slept on his sofa. I didn\'t have a penny on me, and when Ken left to run errands in Aarhus, I had to find something to eat. I\'m not the type to rummage through people\'s things, so I grabbed a bunch of dry spaghetti and ate it raw. I know from experience that spaghetti expands after a while. I\'ve learned this from being a Greenlander without money in Denmark. When it was luxurious, they were cooked, and you got ketchup on them, and if it was really special, there was mustard too.</p>\\n<h2>The End of the Journey</h2>\\n<p>Ken drove me to the rehearsal room early because he had some errands in Aarhus, I think. Here I was, all alone in the rehearsal room without a key. In a backroom of their rehearsal space, there were tons of deposit bottles, so I thought I could allow myself to borrow a few bags. It was back when liter bottles were glass, so I filled two or three bags with them. I knew there was a supermarket nearby, but without a key, it was a bit tricky. I found a stick and set it between the door so it wouldn\'t lock and went to the store, where I bought some cigarettes (a 10-pack), some discounted cold cuts, and water. It was a bit of a gamble because if there had been thieves, they would have had free access to a lot of expensive gear - but hey, I had a good feeling, and fortunately, nothing happened. Henrik (Moorhead), the former drummer, drove me to the station so I could catch the last train to Fyn. On the train, I was in the last car and ran into some Nazi guy - at least he had a swastika on his arm, and he was pretty intrusive, grilling me about where I was from. I had an old trick from before and told him I was from Ireland (I had worked in Dublin in the early \'80s and could easily throw out some words). He bought it and then asked why I had a keyboard with me. I just casually said that I had just bought it used and didn\'t know if it worked (the key was still missing). I couldn\'t get rid of him, and then he pulled out vodka from a backpack and asked if we were going to party... sure, I said, and we sat there singing Irish drinking songs for an hour until I had to get off at Nyborg. I had to go to Horsens again after a while, and I was to attend a party being held at Ken\'s new house... I don\'t remember much from that evening/night, but I did get home. My fingers had started swelling again, so I talked to my dad about what I should do. He advised me to be honest and not put them in a situation where I might have to cancel if I joined. I then called Ken and explained that I was having the same problem as the day he called and that I unfortunately had to back out completely. Ken thought it was a shame but was very understanding, and we hung up. Only after 30+ years have I started again, at least with my own songs from back then... they speak for themselves.</p>\\n","date":"2024-02-19","excerpt":"The Hospital and the CallIn the late \'90s, I was at Nyborg hospital with swollen fingers.
